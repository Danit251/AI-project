Altogether , then , I was scare so miserable the next days but what I had many hopeful and happy snatches ; threw myself with a good deal of constancy upon my studies ; and made out to endure the time till Alan should arrive , or I might hear word of Catriona by the means of James More . I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation . One was to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France , from which place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission . This was to England and to see Lord Holderness ; and it has always been a bitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same . But he has need of a long spoon who soups with the de ’ il , or James More either . During this absence , the time was to fall due for another letter ; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend , he had been so careful as to prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be despatched . The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions , and he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal . What I received began accordingly in the writing of James More : “ My dear Sir ,— Your esteemed favour came to hand duly , and I have to acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement . It shall be all faithfully expended on my daughter , who is well , and desires to be remembered to her dear friend . I find her in rather a melancholy disposition , but trust in the mercy of God to see her re - established . Our manner of life is very much alone , but we solace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains , and by walking up the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland . It was better days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of Gladsmuir . I have found employment here in the _haras_ of a French nobleman , where my experience is valued . But , my dear Sir , the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention them , which makes your remittances the more necessary to my daughter ’ s comfort , though I daresay the sight of old friends would be still better . “ My dear Sir , “ Your affectionate , obedient servant , “ JAMES MACGREGOR DRUMMOND .” Below it began again in the hand of Catriona :— “ Do not be believing him , it is all lies together ,— C . M . D .” Not only did she add this postscript , but I think she must have come near suppressing the letter ; for it came long after date , and was closely followed by the third . In the time betwixt them , Alan had arrived , and made another life to me with his merry conversation ; I had been presented to his cousin of the Scots - Dutch , a man that drank more than I could have thought possible and was not otherwise of interest ; I had been entertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself , all with no great change upon my sorrow ; and we two ( by which I mean Alan and myself , and not at all the cousin ) had discussed a good deal the nature of my relations with James More and his daughter . I was naturally diffident to give particulars ; and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the nature of Alan ’ s commentary upon those I gave . “ I cannae make heed nor tail of it ,” he would say , “ but it sticks in my mind ye ’ ve made a gowk of yourself . There ’ s few people that has had more experience than Alan Breck : and I can never call to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours . The way that you tell it , the thing ’ s fair impossible . Ye must have made a terrible hash of the business , David .” “ There are whiles that I am of the same mind ,” said I . “ The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her too !” said Alan . “ The biggest kind , Alan ,” said I , “ and I think I ’ ll take it to my grave with me .” “ Well , ye beat me , whatever !” he would conclude . I showed him the letter with Catriona ’ s postscript . “ And here again !” he cried . “ Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona , and sense forby ! As for James More , the man ’ s as boss as a drum ; he ’ s just a wame and a wheen words ; though I ’ ll can never deny that he fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir , and it ’ s true what he says here about the five wounds . But the loss of him is that the man ’ s boss .” “ Ye see , Alan ,” said I , “ it goes against the grain with me to leave the maid in such poor hands .” “ Ye couldnae weel find poorer ,” he admitted . “ But what are ye to do with it ? It ’ s this way about a man and a woman , ye see , Davie : The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them . Either they like the man , and then a ’ goes fine ; or else they just detest him , and ye may spare your breath — ye can do naething . There ’ s just the two sets of them — them that would sell their coats for ye , and them that never look the road ye ’ re on . That ’ s a ’ that there is to women ; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither .” “ Well , and I ’ m afraid that ’ s true for me ,” said I . “ And yet there ’ s naething easier !” cried Alan . “ I could easy learn ye the science of the thing ; but ye seem to me to be born blind , and there ’ s where the deefficulty comes in .” “ And can _you_ no help me ?” I asked , “ you that are so clever at the trade ?” “ Ye see , David , I wasnae here ,” said he . “ I ’ m like a field officer that has naebody but blind men for scouts and _éclaireurs_ ; and what would he ken ? But it sticks in my mind that ye ’ ll have made some kind of bauchle ; and if I was you I would have a try at her again .” “ Would ye so , man Alan ?” said I . “ I would e ’ en ’ t ,” says he . The third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk : and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion . James professed to be in some concern upon his daughter ’ s health , which I believe was never better ; abounded in kind expressions to myself ; and finally proposed that I should visit them at Dunkirk . “ You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr . Stewart ,” he wrote . “ Why not accompany him so far in his return to France ? I have something very particular for Mr . Stewart ’ s ear ; and , at any rate , I would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow - soldier and one so mettle as himself . As for you , my dear sir , my daughter and I would be proud to receive our benefactor , whom we regard as a brother and a son . The French nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of character , and I have been necessitate to leave the _haras_ . You will find us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the _auberge_ of a man Bazin on the dunes ; but the situation is caller , and I make no doubt but we might spend some very pleasant days , when Mr . Stewart and I could recall our services , and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner more befitting your age . I beg at least that Mr . Stewart would come here ; my business with him opens a very wide door .” “ What does the man want with me ?” cried Alan , when he had read . “ What he wants with you is clear enough — it ’ s siller . But what can he want with Alan Breck ?” “ O , it ’ ll be just an excuse ,” said I . “ He is still after this marriage , which I wish from my heart that we could bring about . And he asks you because he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you .” “ Well , I wish that I kent ,” says Alan . “ Him and me were never onyways pack ; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers . ‘ Something for my ear ,’ quo ’ he ! I ’ ll maybe have something for his hinder - end , before we ’ re through with it . Dod , I ’ m thinking it would be a kind of divertisement to gang and see what he ’ ll be after ! Forby that I could see your lassie then . What say ye , Davie ? Will ye ride with Alan ?” You may be sure I was not backward , and Alan ’ s furlough running towards an end , we set forth presently upon this joint adventure . It was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the town of Dunkirk . We left our horses at the post , and found a guide to Bazin ’ s Inn , which lay beyond the walls . Night was quite fallen , so that we were the last to leave that fortress , and heard the doors of it close behind us as we passed the bridge . On the other side there lay a lighted suburb , which we thridded for a while , then turned into a dark lane , and presently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand where we could hear a bullering of the sea . We travelled in this fashion for some while , following our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice ; and I had begun to think he was perhaps misleading us , when we came to the top of a small brae , and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in a window . “ _Voilà l ’ auberge à Bazin_ ,” says the guide . Alan smacked his lips . “ An unco lonely bit ,” said he , and I thought by his tone he was not wholly pleased . A little after , and we stood in the lower storey of that house , which was all in the one apartment , with a stairs leading to the chambers at the side , benches and tables by the wall , the cooking fire at the one end of it , and shelves of bottles and the cellar - trap at the other . Here Bazin , who was an ill - looking , big man , told us the Scottish gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where , but the young lady was above , and he would call her down to us . I took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner , and knotted it about my throat . I could hear my heart go ; and Alan patting me on the shoulder with some of his laughable expressions , I could scarce refrain from a sharp word . But the time was not long to wait . I heard her step pass overhead , and saw her on the stair . This she descended very quietly , and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of earnestness , or uneasiness , in her manner that extremely dashed me . “ My father , James More , will be here soon . He will be very pleased to see you ,” she said . And then of a sudden her face flamed , her eyes lightened , the speech stopped upon her lips ; and I made sure she had observed the kerchief . It was only for a breath that she was discomposed ; but methought it was with a new animation that she turned to welcome Alan . “ And you will be his friend , Alan Breck ?” she cried . “ Many is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you ; and I love you already for all your bravery and goodness .” “ Well , well ,” says Alan , holding her hand in his and viewing her , “ and so this is the young lady at the last of it ! David , ye ’ re an awful poor hand of a description .” I do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people ’ s hearts ; the sound of his voice was like song . “ What ? will he have been describing me ?” she cried . “ Little else of it since I ever came out of France !” says he , “ forby a bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by Silvermills . But cheer up , my dear ! ye ’ re bonnier than what he said . And now there ’ s one thing sure ; you and me are to be a pair of friends . I ’ m a kind of a henchman to Davie here ; I ’ m like a tyke at his heels ; and whatever he cares for , I ’ ve got to care for too — and by the holy airn ! they ’ ve got to care for me ! So now you can see what way you stand with Alan Breck , and ye ’ ll find ye ’ ll hardly lose on the transaction . He ’ s no very bonnie , my dear , but he ’ s leal to them he loves .” “ I thank you from my heart for your good words ,” said she . “ I have that honour for a brave , honest man that I cannot find any to be answering with .” Using travellers ’ freedom , we spared to wait for James More , and sat down to meat , we threesome . Alan had Catriona sit by him and wait upon his wants : he made her drink first out of his glass , he surrounded her with continual kind gallantries , and yet never gave me the most small occasion to be jealous ; and he kept the talk so much in his own hand , and that in so merry a note , that neither she nor I remembered to be embarrassed . If any had seen us there , it must have been supposed that Alan was the old friend and I the stranger . Indeed , I had often cause to love and to admire the man , but I never loved or admired him better than that night ; and I could not help remarking to myself ( what I was sometimes rather in danger of forgetting ) that he had not only much experience of life , but in his own way a great deal of natural ability besides . As for Catriona , she seemed quite carried away ; her laugh was like a peal of bells , her face gay as a May morning ; and I own , although I was well pleased , yet I was a little sad also , and thought myself a dull , stockish character in comparison of my friend , and very unfit to come into a young maid ’ s life , and perhaps ding down her gaiety . But if that was like to be my part , I found that at least I was not alone in it ; for , James More returning suddenly , the girl was changed into a piece of stone . Through the rest of that evening , until she made an excuse and slipped to bed , I kept an eye upon her without cease ; and I can bear testimony that she never smiled , scarce spoke , and looked mostly on the board in front of her . So that I really marvelled to see so much devotion ( as it used to be ) changed into the very sickness of hate . Of James More it is unnecessary to say much ; you know the man already , what there was to know of him ; and I am weary of writing out his lies . Enough that he drank a great deal , and told us very little that was to any possible purpose . As for the business with Alan , that was to be reserved for the morrow and his private hearing . It was the more easy to be put off , because Alan and I were pretty weary with four day ’ s ride , and sat not very late after Catriona . We were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make - shift with a single bed . Alan looked on me with a queer smile . “ Ye muckle ass !” said he . “ What do ye mean by that ?” I cried . “ Mean ? What do I mean ! It ’ s extraordinar , David man ,” say he , “ that you should be so mortal stupit .” Again I begged him to speak out . “ Well , it ’ s this of it ,” said he . “ I told ye there were the two kinds of women — them that would sell their shifts for ye , and the others . Just you try for yoursel , my bonny man ! But what ’ s that neepkin at your craig ?” I told him . “ I thocht it was something thereabout ,” said he . Nor would he say another word though I besieged him long with importunities .
