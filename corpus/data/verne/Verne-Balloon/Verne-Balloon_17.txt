At five o ’ clock in the morning , preparations for departure commenced . Joe , with the hatchet which he had fortunately recovered , broke the elephant ’ s tusks . The balloon , restored to liberty , sped away to the northwest with our travellers , at the rate of eighteen miles per hour . The doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the stars , during the preceding night . He knew that he was in latitude two degrees forty minutes below the equator , or at a distance of one hundred and sixty geographical miles . He swept along over many villages without heeding the cries that the appearance of the balloon excited ; he took note of the conformation of places with quick sights ; he passed the slopes of the Rubemhe , which are nearly as abrupt as the summits of the Ousagara , and , farther on , at Tenga , encountered the first projections of the Karagwah chains , which , in his opinion , are direct spurs of the Mountains of the Moon . So , the ancient legend which made these mountains the cradle of the Nile , came near to the truth , since they really border upon Lake Ukereoue , the conjectured reservoir of the waters of the great river . From Kafuro , the main district of the merchants of that country , he descried , at length , on the horizon , the lake so much desired and so long sought for , of which Captain Speke caught a glimpse on the 3d of August , 1858 . Samuel Ferguson felt real emotion : he was almost in contact with one of the principal points of his expedition , and , with his spy - glass constantly raised , he kept every nook and corner of the mysterious region in sight . His gaze wandered over details that might have been thus described : “ Beneath him extended a country generally destitute of cultivation ; only here and there some ravines seemed under tillage ; the surface , dotted with peaks of medium height , grew flat as it approached the lake ; barley - fields took the place of rice - plantations , and there , too , could be seen growing the species of plantain from which the wine of the country is drawn , and mwani , the wild plant which supplies a substitute for coffee . A collection of some fifty or more circular huts , covered with a flowering thatch , constituted the capital of the Karagwah country .” He could easily distinguish the astonished countenances of a rather fine - looking race of natives of yellowish - brown complexion . Women of incredible corpulence were dawdling about through the cultivated grounds , and the doctor greatly surprised his companions by informing them that this rotundity , which is highly esteemed in that region , was obtained by an obligatory diet of curdled milk . At noon , the Victoria was in one degree forty - five minutes south latitude , and at one o ’ clock the wind was driving her directly toward the lake . This sheet of water was christened Uyanza Victoria , or Victoria Lake , by Captain Speke . At the place now mentioned it might measure about ninety miles in breadth , and at its southern extremity the captain found a group of islets , which he named the Archipelago of Bengal . He pushed his survey as far as Muanza , on the eastern coast , where he was received by the sultan . He made a triangulation of this part of the lake , but he could not procure a boat , either to cross it or to visit the great island of Ukereoue which is very populous , is governed by three sultans , and appears to be only a promontory at low tide . The balloon approached the lake more to the northward , to the doctor ’ s great regret , for it had been his wish to determine its lower outlines . Its shores seemed to be thickly set with brambles and thorny plants , growing together in wild confusion , and were literally hidden , sometimes , from the gaze , by myriads of mosquitoes of a light - brown hue . The country was evidently habitable and inhabited . Troops of hippopotami could be seen disporting themselves in the forests of reeds , or plunging beneath the whitish waters of the lake . The latter , seen from above , presented , toward the west , so broad an horizon that it might have been called a sea ; the distance between the two shores is so great that communication cannot be established , and storms are frequent and violent , for the winds sweep with fury over this elevated and unsheltered basin . The doctor experienced some difficulty in guiding his course ; he was afraid of being carried toward the east , but , fortunately , a current bore him directly toward the north , and at six o ’ clock in the evening the balloon alighted on a small desert island in thirty minutes south latitude , and thirty - two degrees fifty - two minutes east longitude , about twenty miles from the shore . The travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree , and , the wind having fallen calm toward evening , they remained quietly at anchor . They dared not dream of taking the ground , since here , as on the shores of the Uyanza , legions of mosquitoes covered the soil in dense clouds . Joe even came back , from securing the anchor in the tree , speckled with bites , but he kept his temper , because he found it quite the natural thing for mosquitoes to treat him as they had done . Nevertheless , the doctor , who was less of an optimist , let out as much rope as he could , so as to escape these pitiless insects , that began to rise toward him with a threatening hum . The doctor ascertained the height of the lake above the level of the sea , as it had been determined by Captain Speke , say three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet . “ Here we are , then , on an island !” said Joe , scratching as though he ’ d tear his nails out . “ We could make the tour of it in a jiffy ,” added Kennedy , “ and , excepting these confounded mosquitoes , there ’ s not a living being to be seen on it .” “ The islands with which the lake is dotted ,” replied the doctor , “ are nothing , after all , but the tops of submerged hills ; but we are lucky to have found a retreat among them , for the shores of the lake are inhabited by ferocious tribes . Take your sleep , then , since Providence has granted us a tranquil night .” “ Won ’ t you do the same , doctor ?” “ No , I could not close my eyes . My thoughts would banish sleep . To - morrow , my friends , should the wind prove favorable , we shall go due north , and we shall , perhaps , discover the sources of the Nile , that grand secret which has so long remained impenetrable . Near as we are to the sources of the renowned river , I could not sleep .” Kennedy and Joe , whom scientific speculations failed to disturb to that extent , were not long in falling into sound slumber , while the doctor held his post . On Wednesday , April 23d , the balloon started at four o ’ clock in the morning , with a grayish sky overhead ; night was slow in quitting the surface of the lake , which was enveloped in a dense fog , but presently a violent breeze scattered all the mists , and , after the balloon had been swung to and fro for a moment , in opposite directions , it at length veered in a straight line toward the north . Dr . Ferguson fairly clapped his hands for joy . “ We are on the right track !” he exclaimed . “ To - day or never we shall see the Nile ! Look , my friends , we are crossing the equator ! We are entering our own hemisphere !” “ Ah !” said Joe , “ do you think , doctor , that the equator passes here ?” “ Just here , my boy !” “ Well , then , with all respect to you , sir , it seems to me that this is the very time to moisten it .” “ Good !” said the doctor , laughing . “ Let us have a glass of punch . You have a way of comprehending cosmography that is any thing but dull .” And thus was the passage of the Victoria over the equator duly celebrated . The balloon made rapid headway . In the west could be seen a low and but slightly - diversified coast , and , farther away in the background , the elevated plains of the Uganda and the Usoga . At length , the rapidity of the wind became excessive , approaching thirty miles per hour . The waters of the Nyanza , violently agitated , were foaming like the billows of a sea . By the appearance of certain long swells that followed the sinking of the waves , the doctor was enabled to conclude that the lake must have great depth of water . Only one or two rude boats were seen during this rapid passage . “ This lake is evidently , from its elevated position , the natural reservoir of the rivers in the eastern part of Africa , and the sky gives back to it in rain what it takes in vapor from the streams that flow out of it . I am certain that the Nile must here take its rise .” “ Well , we shall see !” said Kennedy . About nine o ’ clock they drew nearer to the western coast . It seemed deserted , and covered with woods ; the wind freshened a little toward the east , and the other shore of the lake could be seen . It bent around in such a curve as to end in a wide angle toward two degrees forty minutes north latitude . Lofty mountains uplifted their arid peaks at this extremity of Nyanza ; but , between them , a deep and winding gorge gave exit to a turbulent and foaming river . While busy managing the balloon , Dr . Ferguson never ceased reconnoitring the country with eager eyes . “ Look !” he exclaimed , “ look , my friends ! the statements of the Arabs were correct ! They spoke of a river by which Lake Ukereoue discharged its waters toward the north , and this river exists , and we are descending it , and it flows with a speed analogous to our own ! And this drop of water now gliding away beneath our feet is , beyond all question , rushing on , to mingle with the Mediterranean ! It is the Nile !” “ It is the Nile !” reeechoed Kennedy , carried away by the enthusiasm of his friend . “ Hurrah for the Nile !” shouted Joe , glad , and always ready to cheer for something . Enormous rocks , here and there , embarrassed the course of this mysterious river . The water foamed as it fell in rapids and cataracts , which confirmed the doctor in his preconceived ideas on the subject . From the environing mountains numerous torrents came plunging and seething down , and the eye could take them in by hundreds . There could be seen , starting from the soil , delicate jets of water scattering in all directions , crossing and recrossing each other , mingling , contending in the swiftness of their progress , and all rushing toward that nascent stream which became a river after having drunk them in . “ Here is , indeed , the Nile !” reiterated the doctor , with the tone of profound conviction . “ The origin of its name , like the origin of its waters , has fired the imagination of the learned ; they have sought to trace it from the Greek , the Coptic , the Sanscrit ; but all that matters little now , since we have made it surrender the secret of its source !” “ But ,” said the Scotchman , “ how are you to make sure of the identity of this river with the one recognized by the travellers from the north ?” “ We shall have certain , irrefutable , convincing , and infallible proof ,” replied Ferguson , “ should the wind hold another hour in our favor !” The mountains drew farther apart , revealing in their place numerous villages , and fields of white Indian corn , doura , and sugar - cane . The tribes inhabiting the region seemed excited and hostile ; they manifested more anger than adoration , and evidently saw in the aeronauts only obtrusive strangers , and not condescending deities . It appeared as though , in approaching the sources of the Nile , these men came to rob them of something , and so the Victoria had to keep out of range of their muskets . “ To land here would be a ticklish matter !” said the Scot . “ Well !” said Joe , “ so much the worse for these natives . They ’ ll have to do without the pleasure of our conversation .” “ Nevertheless , descend I must ,” said the doctor , “ were it only for a quarter of an hour . Without doing so I cannot verify the results of our expedition .” “ It is indispensable , then , doctor ?” “ Indispensable ; and we will descend , even if we have to do so with a volley of musketry .” “ The thing suits me ,” said Kennedy , toying with his pet rifle . “ And I ’ m ready , master , whenever you say the word !” added Joe , preparing for the fight . “ It would not be the first time ,” remarked the doctor , “ that science has been followed up , sword in hand . The same thing happened to a French savant among the mountains of Spain , when he was measuring the terrestrial meridian .” “ Be easy on that score , doctor , and trust to your two body - guards .” “ Are we there , master ?” “ Not yet . In fact , I shall go up a little , first , in order to get an exact idea of the configuration of the country .” The hydrogen expanded , and in less than ten minutes the balloon was soaring at a height of twenty - five hundred feet above the ground . From that elevation could be distinguished an inextricable network of smaller streams which the river received into its bosom ; others came from the west , from between numerous hills , in the midst of fertile plains . “ We are not ninety miles from Gondokoro ,” said the doctor , measuring off the distance on his map , “ and less than five miles from the point reached by the explorers from the north . Let us descend with great care .” And , upon this , the balloon was lowered about two thousand feet . “ Now , my friends , let us be ready , come what may .” “ Ready it is !” said Dick and Joe , with one voice . “ Good !” In a few moments the balloon was advancing along the bed of the river , and scarcely one hundred feet above the ground . The Nile measured but fifty fathoms in width at this point , and the natives were in great excitement , rushing to and fro , tumultuously , in the villages that lined the banks of the stream . At the second degree it forms a perpendicular cascade of ten feet in height , and consequently impassable by boats . “ Here , then , is the cascade mentioned by Debono !” exclaimed the doctor . The basin of the river spread out , dotted with numerous islands , which Dr . Ferguson devoured with his eyes . He seemed to be seeking for a point of reference which he had not yet found . By this time , some blacks , having ventured in a boat just under the balloon , Kennedy saluted them with a shot from his rifle , that made them regain the bank at their utmost speed . “ A good journey to you ,” bawled Joe , “ and if I were in your place , I wouldn ’ t try coming back again . I should be mightily afraid of a monster that can hurl thunderbolts when he pleases .” But , all at once , the doctor snatched up his spy - glass , and directed it toward an island reposing in the middle of the river . “ Four trees !” he exclaimed ; “ look , down there !” Sure enough , there were four trees standing alone at one end of it . “ It is Bengal Island ! It is the very same ,” repeated the doctor , exultingly . “ And what of that ?” asked Dick . “ It is there that we shall alight , if God permits .” “ But , it seems to be inhabited , doctor .” “ Joe is right ; and , unless I ’ m mistaken , there is a group of about a score of natives on it now .” “ We ’ ll make them scatter ; there ’ ll be no great trouble in that ,” responded Ferguson . “ So be it ,” chimed in the hunter . The sun was at the zenith as the balloon approached the island . The blacks , who were members of the Makado tribe , were howling lustily , and one of them waved his bark hat in the air . Kennedy took aim at him , fired , and his hat flew about him in pieces . Thereupon there was a general scamper . The natives plunged headlong into the river , and swam to the opposite bank . Immediately , there came a shower of balls from both banks , along with a perfect cloud of arrows , but without doing the balloon any damage , where it rested with its anchor snugly secured in the fissure of a rock . Joe lost no time in sliding to the ground . “ The ladder !” cried the doctor . “ Follow me , Kennedy .” “ What do you wish , sir ?” “ Let us alight . I want a witness .” “ Here I am !” “ Mind your post , Joe , and keep a good lookout .” “ Never fear , doctor ; I ’ ll answer for all that .” “ Come , Dick ,” said the doctor , as he touched the ground . So saying , he drew his companion along toward a group of rocks that rose upon one point of the island ; there , after searching for some time , he began to rummage among the brambles , and , in so doing , scratched his hands until they bled . Suddenly he grasped Kennedy ’ s arm , exclaiming : “ Look ! look !” “ Letters !” Yes ; there , indeed , could be descried , with perfect precision of outline , some letters carved on the rock . It was quite easy to make them out : “ A . D .” “ A . D . !” repeated Dr . Ferguson . “ Andrea Debono -- the very signature of the traveller who farthest ascended the current of the Nile .” “ No doubt of that , friend Samuel ,” assented Kennedy . “ Are you now convinced ?” “ It is the Nile ! We cannot entertain a doubt on that score now ,” was the reply . The doctor , for the last time , examined those precious initials , the exact form and size of which he carefully noted . “ And now ,” said he --“ now for the balloon !” “ Quickly , then , for I see some of the natives getting ready to recross the river .” “ That matters little to us now . Let the wind but send us northward for a few hours , and we shall reach Gondokoro , and press the hands of some of our countrymen .” Ten minutes more , and the balloon was majestically ascending , while Dr . Ferguson , in token of success , waved the English flag triumphantly from his car .
