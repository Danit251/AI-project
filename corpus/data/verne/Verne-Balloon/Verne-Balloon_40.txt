On the 27th of May , at nine o ’ clock in the morning , the country presented an entirely different aspect . The slopes , extending far away , changed to hills that gave evidence of mountains soon to follow . They would have to cross the chain which separates the basin of the Niger from the basin of the Senegal , and determines the course of the water - shed , whether to the Gulf of Guinea on the one hand , or to the bay of Cape Verde on the other . As far as Senegal , this part of Africa is marked down as dangerous . Dr . Ferguson knew it through the recitals of his predecessors . They had suffered a thousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers in the midst of these barbarous negro tribes . It was this fatal climate that had devoured most of the companions of Mungo Park . Ferguson , therefore , was more than ever decided not to set foot in this inhospitable region . But he had not enjoyed one moment of repose . The Victoria was descending very perceptibly , so much so that he had to throw overboard a number more of useless articles , especially when there was a mountain - top to pass . Things went on thus for more than one hundred and twenty miles ; they were worn out with ascending and falling again ; the balloon , like another rock of Sisyphus , kept continually sinking back toward the ground . The rotundity of the covering , which was now but little inflated , was collapsing already . It assumed an elongated shape , and the wind hollowed large cavities in the silken surface . Kennedy could not help observing this . “ Is there a crack or a tear in the balloon ?” he asked . “ No , but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat , and the hydrogen is escaping through the silk .” “ How can we prevent that ?” “ It is impossible . Let us lighten her . That is the only help . So let us throw out every thing we can spare .” “ But what shall it be ?” said the hunter , looking at the car , which was already quite bare . “ Well , let us get rid of the awning , for its weight is quite considerable .” Joe , who was interested in this order , climbed up on the circle which kept together the cordage of the network , and from that place easily managed to detach the heavy curtains of the awning and throw them overboard . “ There ’ s something that will gladden the hearts of a whole tribe of blacks ,” said he ; “ there ’ s enough to dress a thousand of them , for they ’ re not very extravagant with cloth .” The balloon had risen a little , but it soon became evident that it was again approaching the ground . “ Let us alight ,” suggested Kennedy , “ and see what can be done with the covering of the balloon .” “ I tell you , again , Dick , that we have no means of repairing it .” “ Then what shall we do ?” “ We ’ ll have to sacrifice every thing not absolutely indispensable ; I am anxious , at all hazards , to avoid a detention in these regions . The forests over the tops of which we are skimming are any thing but safe .” “ What ! are there lions in them , or hyenas ?” asked Joe , with an expression of sovereign contempt . “ Worse than that , my boy ! There are men , and some of the most cruel , too , in all Africa .” “ How is that known ?” “ By the statements of travellers who have been here before us . Then the French settlers , who occupy the colony of Senegal , necessarily have relations with the surrounding tribes . Under the administration of Colonel Faidherbe , reconnaissances have been pushed far up into the country . Officers such as Messrs . Pascal , Vincent , and Lambert , have brought back precious documents from their expeditions . They have explored these countries formed by the elbow of the Senegal in places where war and pillage have left nothing but ruins .” “ What , then , took place ?” “ I will tell you . In 1854 a Marabout of the Senegalese Fouta , Al - Hadji by name , declaring himself to be inspired like Mohammed , stirred up all the tribes to war against the infidels -- that is to say , against the Europeans . He carried destruction and desolation over the regions between the Senegal River and its tributary , the Fateme . Three hordes of fanatics led on by him scoured the country , sparing neither a village nor a hut in their pillaging , massacring career . He advanced in person on the town of Sego , which was a long time threatened . In 1857 he worked up farther to the northward , and invested the fortification of Medina , built by the French on the bank of the river . This stronghold was defended by Paul Holl , who , for several months , without provisions or ammunition , held out until Colonel Faidherbe came to his relief . Al - Hadji and his bands then repassed the Senegal , and reappeared in the Kaarta , continuing their rapine and murder .-- Well , here below us is the very country in which he has found refuge with his hordes of banditti ; and I assure you that it would not be a good thing to fall into his hands .” “ We shall not ,” said Joe , “ even if we have to throw overboard our clothes to save the Victoria .” “ We are not far from the river ,” said the doctor , “ but I foresee that our balloon will not be able to carry us beyond it .” “ Let us reach its banks , at all events ,” said the Scot , “ and that will be so much gained .” “ That is what we are trying to do ,” rejoined Ferguson , “ only that one thing makes me feel anxious .” “ What is that ?” “ We shall have mountains to pass , and that will be difficult to do , since I cannot augment the ascensional force of the balloon , even with the greatest possible heat that I can produce .” “ Well , wait a bit ,” said Kennedy , “ and we shall see !” “ The poor Victoria !” sighed Joe ; “ I had got fond of her as the sailor does of his ship , and I ’ ll not give her up so easily . She may not be what she was at the start -- granted ; but we shouldn ’ t say a word against her . She has done us good service , and it would break my heart to desert her .” “ Be at your ease , Joe ; if we leave her , it will be in spite of ourselves . She ’ ll serve us until she ’ s completely worn out , and I ask of her only twenty - four hours more !” “ Ah , she ’ s getting used up ! She grows thinner and thinner ,” said Joe , dolefully , while he eyed her . “ Poor balloon !” “ Unless I am deceived ,” said Kennedy , “ there on the horizon are the mountains of which you were speaking , doctor .” “ Yes , there they are , indeed !” exclaimed the doctor , after having examined them through his spy - glass , “ and they look very high . We shall have some trouble in crossing them .” “ Can we not avoid them ?” “ I am afraid not , Dick . See what an immense space they occupy -- nearly one - half of the horizon !” “ They even seem to shut us in ,” added Joe . “ They are gaining on both our right and our left .” “ We must then pass over them .” These obstacles , which threatened such imminent peril , seemed to approach with extreme rapidity , or , to speak more accurately , the wind , which was very fresh , was hurrying the balloon toward the sharp peaks . So rise it must , or be dashed to pieces . “ Let us empty our tank of water ,” said the doctor , “ and keep only enough for one day .” “ There it goes ,” shouted Joe . “ Does the balloon rise at all ?” asked Kennedy . “ A little -- some fifty feet ,” replied the doctor , who kept his eyes fixed on the barometer . “ But that is not enough .” In truth the lofty peaks were starting up so swiftly before the travellers that they seemed to be rushing down upon them . The balloon was far from rising above them . She lacked an elevation of more than five hundred feet more . The stock of water for the cylinder was also thrown overboard and only a few pints were retained , but still all this was not enough . “ We must pass them though !” urged the doctor . “ Let us throw out the tanks -- we have emptied them .” said Kennedy . “ Over with them !” “ There they go !” panted Joe . “ But it ’ s hard to see ourselves dropping off this way by piecemeal .” “ Now , for your part , Joe , make no attempt to sacrifice yourself as you did the other day ! Whatever happens , swear to me that you will not leave us !” “ Have no fears , my master , we shall not be separated .” The Victoria had ascended some hundred and twenty feet , but the crest of the mountain still towered above it . It was an almost perpendicular ridge that ended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line . It still rose more than two hundred feet over the aeronauts . “ In ten minutes ,” said the doctor to himself , “ our car will be dashed against those rocks unless we succeed in passing them !” “ Well , doctor ?” queried Joe . “ Keep nothing but our pemmican , and throw out all the heavy meat .” Thereupon the balloon was again lightened by some fifty pounds , and it rose very perceptibly , but that was of little consequence , unless it got above the line of the mountain - tops . The situation was terrifying . The Victoria was rushing on with great rapidity . They could feel that she would be dashed to pieces -- that the shock would be fearful . The doctor glanced around him in the car . It was nearly empty . “ If needs be , Dick , hold yourself in readiness to throw over your fire - arms !” “ Sacrifice my fire - arms ?” repeated the sportsman , with intense feeling . “ My friend , I ask it ; it will be absolutely necessary !” “ Samuel ! Doctor !” “ Your guns , and your stock of powder and ball might cost us our lives .” “ We are close to it !” cried Joe . Sixty feet ! The mountain still overtopped the balloon by sixty feet . Joe took the blankets and other coverings and tossed them out ; then , without a word to Kennedy , he threw over several bags of bullets and lead . The balloon went up still higher ; it surmounted the dangerous ridge , and the rays of the sun shone upon its uppermost extremity ; but the car was still below the level of certain broken masses of rock , against which it would inevitably be dashed . “ Kennedy ! Kennedy ! throw out your fire - arms , or we are lost !” shouted the doctor . “ Wait , sir ; wait one moment !” they heard Joe exclaim , and , looking around , they saw Joe disappear over the edge of the balloon . “ Joe ! Joe !” cried Kennedy . “ Wretched man !” was the doctor ’ s agonized expression . The flat top of the mountain may have had about twenty feet in breadth at this point , and , on the other side , the slope presented a less declivity . The car just touched the level of this plane , which happened to be quite even , and it glided over a soil composed of sharp pebbles that grated as it passed . “ We ’ re over it ! we ’ re over it ! we ’ re clear !” cried out an exulting voice that made Ferguson ’ s heart leap to his throat . The daring fellow was there , grasping the lower rim of the car , and running afoot over the top of the mountain , thus lightening the balloon of his whole weight . He had to hold on with all his strength , too , for it was likely to escape his grasp at any moment . When he had reached the opposite declivity , and the abyss was before him , Joe , by a vigorous effort , hoisted himself from the ground , and , clambering up by the cordage , rejoined his friends . “ That was all !” he coolly ejaculated . “ My brave Joe ! my friend !” said the doctor , with deep emotion . “ Oh ! what I did ,” laughed the other , “ was not for you ; it was to save Mr . Kennedy ’ s rifle . I owed him that good turn for the affair with the Arab ! I like to pay my debts , and now we are even ,” added he , handing to the sportsman his favorite weapon . “ I ’ d feel very badly to see you deprived of it .” Kennedy heartily shook the brave fellow ’ s hand , without being able to utter a word . The Victoria had nothing to do now but to descend . That was easy enough , so that she was soon at a height of only two hundred feet from the ground , and was then in equilibrium . The surface seemed very much broken as though by a convulsion of nature . It presented numerous inequalities , which would have been very difficult to avoid during the night with a balloon that could no longer be controlled . Evening was coming on rapidly , and , notwithstanding his repugnance , the doctor had to make up his mind to halt until morning . “ We ’ ll now look for a favorable stopping - place ,” said he . “ Ah !” replied Kennedy , “ you have made up your mind , then , at last ?” “ Yes , I have for a long time been thinking over a plan which we ’ ll try to put into execution ; it is only six o ’ clock in the evening , and we shall have time enough . Throw out your anchors , Joe !” Joe immediately obeyed , and the two anchors dangled below the balloon . “ I see large forests ahead of us ,” said the doctor ; “ we are going to sweep along their tops , and we shall grapple to some tree , for nothing would make me think of passing the night below , on the ground .” “ But can we not descend ?” asked Kennedy . “ To what purpose ? I repeat that it would be dangerous for us to separate , and , besides , I claim your help for a difficult piece of work .” The Victoria , which was skimming along the tops of immense forests , soon came to a sharp halt . Her anchors had caught , and , the wind falling as dusk came on , she remained motionlessly suspended above a vast field of verdure , formed by the tops of a forest of sycamores .
