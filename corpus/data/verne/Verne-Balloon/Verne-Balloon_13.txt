The Forest of Gum - Trees .-- The Blue Antelope .-- The Rallying - Signal .-- An Unexpected Attack .-- The Kanyeme .-- A Night in the Open Air .-- The Mabunguru .-- Jihoue - la - Mkoa .-- A Supply of Water .-- Arrival at Kazeh . The country , dry and parched as it was , consisting of a clayey soil that cracked open with the heat , seemed , indeed , a desert : here and there were a few traces of caravans ; the bones of men and animals , that had been half - gnawed away , mouldering together in the same dust . After half an hour ’ s walking , Dick and Joe plunged into a forest of gum - trees , their eyes alert on all sides , and their fingers on the trigger . There was no foreseeing what they might encounter . Without being a rifleman , Joe could handle fire - arms with no trifling dexterity . “ A walk does one good , Mr . Kennedy , but this isn ’ t the easiest ground in the world ,” he said , kicking aside some fragments of quartz with which the soil was bestrewn . Kennedy motioned to his companion to be silent and to halt . The present case compelled them to dispense with hunting - dogs , and , no matter what Joe ’ s agility might be , he could not be expected to have the scent of a setter or a greyhound . A herd of a dozen antelopes were quenching their thirst in the bed of a torrent where some pools of water had lodged . The graceful creatures , snuffing danger in the breeze , seemed to be disturbed and uneasy . Their beautiful heads could be seen between every draught , raised in the air with quick and sudden motion as they sniffed the wind in the direction of our two hunters , with their flexible nostrils . Kennedy stole around behind some clumps of shrubbery , while Joe remained motionless where he was . The former , at length , got within gunshot and fired . The herd disappeared in the twinkling of an eye ; one male antelope only , that was hit just behind the shoulder - joint , fell headlong to the ground , and Kennedy leaped toward his booty . It was a blauwbok , a superb animal of a pale - bluish color shading upon the gray , but with the belly and the inside of the legs as white as the driven snow . “ A splendid shot !” exclaimed the hunter . “ It ’ s a very rare species of the antelope , and I hope to be able to prepare his skin in such a way as to keep it .” “ Indeed !” said Joe , “ do you think of doing that , Mr . Kennedy ?” “ Why , certainly I do ! Just see what a fine hide it is !” “ But Dr . Ferguson will never allow us to take such an extra weight !” “ You ’ re right , Joe . Still it is a pity to have to leave such a noble animal .” “ The whole of it ? Oh , we won ’ t do that , sir ; we ’ ll take all the good eatable parts of it , and , if you ’ ll let me , I ’ ll cut him up just as well as the chairman of the honorable corporation of butchers of the city of London could do .” “ As you please , my boy ! But you know that in my hunter ’ s way I can just as easily skin and cut up a piece of game as kill it .” “ I ’ m sure of that , Mr . Kennedy . Well , then , you can build a fireplace with a few stones ; there ’ s plenty of dry dead - wood , and I can make the hot coals tell in a few minutes .” “ Oh ! that won ’ t take long ,” said Kennedy , going to work on the fireplace , where he had a brisk flame crackling and sparkling in a minute or two . Joe had cut some of the nicest steaks and the best parts of the tenderloin from the carcass of the antelope , and these were quickly transformed to the most savory of broils . “ There , those will tickle the doctor !” said Kennedy . “ Do you know what I was thinking about ?” said Joe . “ Why , about the steaks you ’ re broiling , to be sure !” replied Dick . “ Not the least in the world . I was thinking what a figure we ’ d cut if we couldn ’ t find the balloon again .” “ By George , what an idea ! Why , do you think the doctor would desert us ?” “ No ; but suppose his anchor were to slip !” “ Impossible ! and , besides , the doctor would find no difficulty in coming down again with his balloon ; he handles it at his ease .” “ But suppose the wind were to sweep it off , so that he couldn ’ t come back toward us ?” “ Come , come , Joe ! a truce to your suppositions ; they ’ re any thing but pleasant .” “ Ah ! sir , every thing that happens in this world is natural , of course ; but , then , any thing may happen , and we ought to look out beforehand .” At this moment the report of a gun rang out upon the air . “ What ’ s that ?” exclaimed Joe . “ It ’ s my rifle , I know the ring of her !” said Kennedy . “ A signal !” “ Yes ; danger for us !” “ For him , too , perhaps .” “ Let ’ s be off !” And the hunters , having gathered up the product of their expedition , rapidly made their way back along the path that they had marked by breaking boughs and bushes when they came . The density of the underbrush prevented their seeing the balloon , although they could not be far from it . A second shot was heard . “ We must hurry !” said Joe . “ There ! a third report !” “ Why , it sounds to me as if he was defending himself against something .” “ Let us make haste !” They now began to run at the top of their speed . When they reached the outskirts of the forest , they , at first glance , saw the balloon in its place and the doctor in the car . “ What ’ s the matter ?” shouted Kennedy . “ Good God !” suddenly exclaimed Joe . “ What do you see ?” “ Down there ! look ! a crowd of blacks surrounding the balloon !” And , in fact , there , two miles from where they were , they saw some thirty wild natives close together , yelling , gesticulating , and cutting all kinds of antics at the foot of the sycamore . Some , climbing into the tree itself , were making their way to the topmost branches . The danger seemed pressing . “ My master is lost !” cried Joe . “ Come ! a little more coolness , Joe , and let us see how we stand . We hold the lives of four of those villains in our hands . Forward , then !” They had made a mile with headlong speed , when another report was heard from the car . The shot had , evidently , told upon a huge black demon , who had been hoisting himself up by the anchor - rope . A lifeless body fell from bough to bough , and hung about twenty feet from the ground , its arms and legs swaying to and fro in the air . “ Ha !” said Joe , halting , “ what does that fellow hold by ?” “ No matter what !” said Kennedy ; “ let us run ! let us run !” “ Ah ! Mr . Kennedy ,” said Joe , again , in a roar of laughter , “ by his tail ! by his tail ! it ’ s an ape ! They ’ re all apes !” “ Well , they ’ re worse than men !” said Kennedy , as he dashed into the midst of the howling crowd . It was , indeed , a troop of very formidable baboons of the dog - faced species . These creatures are brutal , ferocious , and horrible to look upon , with their dog - like muzzles and savage expression . However , a few shots scattered them , and the chattering horde scampered off , leaving several of their number on the ground . In a moment Kennedy was on the ladder , and Joe , clambering up the branches , detached the anchor ; the car then dipped to where he was , and he got into it without difficulty . A few minutes later , the Victoria slowly ascended and soared away to the eastward , wafted by a moderate wind . “ That was an attack for you !” said Joe . “ We thought you were surrounded by natives .” “ Well , fortunately , they were only apes ,” said the doctor . “ At a distance there ’ s no great difference ,” remarked Kennedy . “ Nor close at hand , either ,” added Joe . “ Well , however that may be ,” resumed Ferguson , “ this attack of apes might have had the most serious consequences . Had the anchor yielded to their repeated efforts , who knows whither the wind would have carried me ?” “ What did I tell you , Mr . Kennedy ?” “ You were right , Joe ; but , even right as you may have been , you were , at that moment , preparing some antelope - steaks , the very sight of which gave me a monstrous appetite .” “ I believe you !” said the doctor ; “ the flesh of the antelope is exquisite .” “ You may judge of that yourself , now , sir , for supper ’ s ready .” “ Upon my word as a sportsman , those venison - steaks have a gamy flavor that ’ s not to be sneezed at , I tell you .” “ Good !” said Joe , with his mouth full , “ I could live on antelope all the days of my life ; and all the better with a glass of grog to wash it down .” So saying , the good fellow went to work to prepare a jorum of that fragrant beverage , and all hands tasted it with satisfaction . “ Every thing has gone well thus far ,” said he . “ Very well indeed !” assented Kennedy . “ Come , now , Mr . Kennedy , are you sorry that you came with us ?” “ I ’ d like to see anybody prevent my coming !” It was now four o ’ clock in the afternoon . The Victoria had struck a more rapid current . The face of the country was gradually rising , and , ere long , the barometer indicated a height of fifteen hundred feet above the level of the sea . The doctor was , therefore , obliged to keep his balloon up by a quite considerable dilation of gas , and the cylinder was hard at work all the time . Toward seven o ’ clock , the balloon was sailing over the basin of Kanyeme . The doctor immediately recognized that immense clearing , ten miles in extent , with its villages buried in the midst of baobab and calabash trees . It is the residence of one of the sultans of the Ugogo country , where civilization is , perhaps , the least backward . The natives there are less addicted to selling members of their own families , but still , men and animals all live together in round huts , without frames , that look like haystacks . Beyond Kanyeme the soil becomes arid and stony , but in an hour ’ s journey , in a fertile dip of the soil , vegetation had resumed all its vigor at some distance from Mdaburu . The wind fell with the close of the day , and the atmosphere seemed to sleep . The doctor vainly sought for a current of air at different heights , and , at last , seeing this calm of all nature , he resolved to pass the night afloat , and , for greater safety , rose to the height of one thousand feet , where the balloon remained motionless . The night was magnificent , the heavens glittering with stars , and profoundly silent in the upper air . Dick and Joe stretched themselves on their peaceful couch , and were soon sound asleep , the doctor keeping the first watch . At twelve o ’ clock the latter was relieved by Kennedy . “ Should the slightest accident happen , waken me ,” said Ferguson , “ and , above all things , don ’ t lose sight of the barometer . To us it is the compass !” The night was cold . There were twenty - seven degrees of difference between its temperature and that of the daytime . With nightfall had begun the nocturnal concert of animals driven from their hiding - places by hunger and thirst . The frogs struck in their guttural soprano , redoubled by the yelping of the jackals , while the imposing bass of the African lion sustained the accords of this living orchestra . Upon resuming his post , in the morning , the doctor consulted his compass , and found that the wind had changed during the night . The balloon had been bearing about thirty miles to the northwest during the last two hours . It was then passing over Mabunguru , a stony country , strewn with blocks of syenite of a fine polish , and knobbed with huge bowlders and angular ridges of rock ; conic masses , like the rocks of Karnak , studded the soil like so many Druidic dolmens ; the bones of buffaloes and elephants whitened it here and there ; but few trees could be seen , excepting in the east , where there were dense woods , among which a few villages lay half concealed . Toward seven o ’ clock they saw a huge round rock nearly two miles in extent , like an immense tortoise . “ We are on the right track ,” said Dr . Ferguson . “ There ’ s Jihoue - la - Mkoa , where we must halt for a few minutes . I am going to renew the supply of water necessary for my cylinder , and so let us try to anchor somewhere .” “ There are very few trees ,” replied the hunter . “ Never mind , let us try . Joe , throw out the anchors !” The balloon , gradually losing its ascensional force , approached the ground ; the anchors ran along until , at last , one of them caught in the fissure of a rock , and the balloon remained motionless . It must not be supposed that the doctor could entirely extinguish his cylinder , during these halts . The equilibrium of the balloon had been calculated at the level of the sea ; and , as the country was continually ascending , and had reached an elevation of from six to seven hundred feet , the balloon would have had a tendency to go lower than the surface of the soil itself . It was , therefore , necessary to sustain it by a certain dilation of the gas . But , in case the doctor , in the absence of all wind , had let the car rest upon the ground , the balloon , thus relieved of a considerable weight , would have kept up of itself , without the aid of the cylinder . The maps indicated extensive ponds on the western slope of the Jihoue - la - Mkoa . Joe went thither alone with a cask that would hold about ten gallons . He found the place pointed out to him , without difficulty , near to a deserted village ; got his stock of water , and returned in less than three - quarters of an hour . He had seen nothing particular excepting some immense elephant - pits . In fact , he came very near falling into one of them , at the bottom of which lay a half - eaten carcass . He brought back with him a sort of clover which the apes eat with avidity . The doctor recognized the fruit of the “ mbenbu ”-- tree which grows in profusion , on the western part of Jihoue - la - Mkoa . Ferguson waited for Joe with a certain feeling of impatience , for even a short halt in this inhospitable region always inspires a degree of fear . The water was got aboard without trouble , as the car was nearly resting on the ground . Joe then found it easy to loosen the anchor and leaped lightly to his place beside the doctor . The latter then replenished the flame in the cylinder , and the balloon majestically soared into the air . It was then about one hundred miles from Kazeh , an important establishment in the interior of Africa , where , thanks to a south - southeasterly current , the travellers might hope to arrive on that same day . They were moving at the rate of fourteen miles per hour , and the guidance of the balloon was becoming difficult , as they dared not rise very high without extreme dilation of the gas , the country itself being at an average height of three thousand feet . Hence , the doctor preferred not to force the dilation , and so adroitly followed the sinuosities of a pretty sharply - inclined plane , and swept very close to the villages of Thembo and Tura - Wels . The latter forms part of the Unyamwezy , a magnificent country , where the trees attain enormous dimensions ; among them the cactus , which grows to gigantic size . About two o ’ clock , in magnificent weather , but under a fiery sun that devoured the least breath of air , the balloon was floating over the town of Kazeh , situated about three hundred and fifty miles from the coast . “ We left Zanzibar at nine o ’ clock in the morning ,” said the doctor , consulting his notes , “ and , after two days ’ passage , we have , including our deviations , travelled nearly five hundred geographical miles . Captains Burton and Speke took four months and a half to make the same distance !”
