Terrific Heat .-- Hallucinations .-- The Last Drops of Water .-- Nights of Despair .-- An Attempt at Suicide .-- The Simoom .-- The Oasis .-- The Lion and Lioness . The doctor ’ s first care , on the morrow , was to consult the barometer . He found that the mercury had scarcely undergone any perceptible depression . “ Nothing !” he murmured , “ nothing !” He got out of the car and scrutinized the weather ; there was only the same heat , the same cloudless sky , the same merciless drought . “ Must we , then , give up to despair ?” he exclaimed , in agony . Joe did not open his lips . He was buried in his own thoughts , and planning the expedition he had proposed . Kennedy got up , feeling very ill , and a prey to nervous agitation . He was suffering horribly with thirst , and his swollen tongue and lips could hardly articulate a syllable . There still remained a few drops of water . Each of them knew this , and each was thinking of it , and felt himself drawn toward them ; but neither of the three dared to take a step . Those three men , friends and companions as they were , fixed their haggard eyes upon each other with an instinct of ferocious longing , which was most plainly revealed in the hardy Scot , whose vigorous constitution yielded the soonest to these unnatural privations . Throughout the day he was delirious , pacing up and down , uttering hoarse cries , gnawing his clinched fists , and ready to open his veins and drink his own hot blood . “ Ah !” he cried , “ land of thirst ! Well might you be called the land of despair !” At length he sank down in utter prostration , and his friends heard no other sound from him than the hissing of his breath between his parched and swollen lips . Toward evening , Joe had his turn of delirium . The vast expanse of sand appeared to him an immense pond , full of clear and limpid water ; and , more than once , he dashed himself upon the scorching waste to drink long draughts , and rose again with his mouth clogged with hot dust . “ Curses on it !” he yelled , in his madness , “ it ’ s nothing but salt water !” Then , while Ferguson and Kennedy lay there motionless , the resistless longing came over him to drain the last few drops of water that had been kept in reserve . The natural instinct proved too strong . He dragged himself toward the car , on his knees ; he glared at the bottle containing the precious fluid ; he gave one wild , eager glance , seized the treasured store , and bore it to his lips . At that instant he heard a heart - rending cry close beside him --“ Water ! water !” It was Kennedy , who had crawled up close to him , and was begging there , upon his knees , and weeping piteously . Joe , himself in tears , gave the poor wretch the bottle , and Kennedy drained the last drop with savage haste . “ Thanks !” he murmured hoarsely , but Joe did not hear him , for both alike had dropped fainting on the sand . What took place during that fearful night neither of them knew , but , on Tuesday morning , under those showers of heat which the sun poured down upon them , the unfortunate men felt their limbs gradually drying up , and when Joe attempted to rise he found it impossible . He looked around him . In the car , the doctor , completely overwhelmed , sat with his arms folded on his breast , gazing with idiotic fixedness upon some imaginary point in space . Kennedy was frightful to behold . He was rolling his head from right to left like a wild beast in a cage . All at once , his eyes rested on the butt of his rifle , which jutted above the rim of the car . “ Ah !” he screamed , raising himself with a superhuman effort . Desperate , mad , he snatched at the weapon , and turned the barrel toward his mouth . “ Kennedy !” shouted Joe , throwing himself upon his friend . “ Let go ! hands off !” moaned the Scot , in a hoarse , grating voice -- and then the two struggled desperately for the rifle . “ Let go , or I ’ ll kill you !” repeated Kennedy . But Joe clung to him only the more fiercely , and they had been contending thus without the doctor seeing them for many seconds , when , suddenly the rifle went off . At the sound of its discharge , the doctor rose up erect , like a spectre , and glared around him . But all at once his glance grew more animated ; he extended his hand toward the horizon , and in a voice no longer human shrieked : “ There ! there -- off there !” There was such fearful force in the cry that Kennedy and Joe released each other , and both looked where the doctor pointed . The plain was agitated like the sea shaken by the fury of a tempest ; billows of sand went tossing over each other amid blinding clouds of dust ; an immense pillar was seen whirling toward them through the air from the southeast , with terrific velocity ; the sun was disappearing behind an opaque veil of cloud whose enormous barrier extended clear to the horizon , while the grains of fine sand went gliding together with all the supple ease of liquid particles , and the rising dust - tide gained more and more with every second . Ferguson ’ s eyes gleamed with a ray of energetic hope . “ The simoom !” he exclaimed . “ The simoom !” repeated Joe , without exactly knowing what it meant . “ So much the better !” said Kennedy , with the bitterness of despair . “ So much the better -- we shall die !” “ So much the better !” echoed the doctor , “ for we shall live !” and , so saying , he began rapidly to throw out the sand that encumbered the car . At length his companions understood him , and took their places at his side . “ And now , Joe ,” said the doctor , “ throw out some fifty pounds of your ore , there !” Joe no longer hesitated , although he still felt a fleeting pang of regret . The balloon at once began to ascend . “ It was high time !” said the doctor . The simoom , in fact , came rushing on like a thunderbolt , and a moment later the balloon would have been crushed , torn to atoms , annihilated . The awful whirlwind was almost upon it , and it was already pelted with showers of sand driven like hail by the storm . “ Out with more ballast !” shouted the doctor . “ There !” responded Joe , tossing over a huge fragment of quartz . With this , the Victoria rose swiftly above the range of the whirling column , but , caught in the vast displacement of the atmosphere thereby occasioned , it was borne along with incalculable rapidity away above this foaming sea . The three travellers did not speak . They gazed , and hoped , and even felt refreshed by the breath of the tempest . About three o ’ clock , the whirlwind ceased ; the sand , falling again upon the desert , formed numberless little hillocks , and the sky resumed its former tranquillity . The balloon , which had again lost its momentum , was floating in sight of an oasis , a sort of islet studded with green trees , thrown up upon the surface of this sandy ocean . “ Water ! we ’ ll find water there !” said the doctor . And , instantly , opening the upper valve , he let some hydrogen escape , and slowly descended , taking the ground at about two hundred feet from the edge of the oasis . In four hours the travellers had swept over a distance of two hundred and forty miles ! The car was at once ballasted , and Kennedy , closely followed by Joe , leaped out . “ Take your guns with you !” said the doctor ; “ take your guns , and be careful !” Dick grasped his rifle , and Joe took one of the fowling - pieces . They then rapidly made for the trees , and disappeared under the fresh verdure , which announced the presence of abundant springs . As they hurried on , they had not taken notice of certain large footprints and fresh tracks of some living creature marked here and there in the damp soil . Suddenly , a dull roar was heard not twenty paces from them . “ The roar of a lion !” said Joe . “ Good for that !” said the excited hunter ; “ we ’ ll fight him . A man feels strong when only a fight ’ s in question .” “ But be careful , Mr . Kennedy ; be careful ! The lives of all depend upon the life of one .” But Kennedy no longer heard him ; he was pushing on , his eye blazing ; his rifle cocked ; fearful to behold in his daring rashness . There , under a palm - tree , stood an enormous black - maned lion , crouching for a spring on his antagonist . Scarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter , when he bounded through the air ; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet pierced his heart , and he fell to the earth dead . “ Hurrah ! hurrah !” shouted Joe , with wild exultation . Kennedy rushed toward the well , slid down the dampened steps , and flung himself at full length by the side of a fresh spring , in which he plunged his parched lips . Joe followed suit , and for some minutes nothing was heard but the sound they made with their mouths , drinking more like maddened beasts than men . “ Take care , Mr . Kennedy ,” said Joe at last ; “ let us not overdo the thing !” and he panted for breath . But Kennedy , without a word , drank on . He even plunged his hands , and then his head , into the delicious tide -- he fairly revelled in its coolness . “ But the doctor ?” said Joe ; “ our friend , Dr . Ferguson ?” That one word recalled Kennedy to himself , and , hastily filling a flask that he had brought with him , he started on a run up the steps of the well . But what was his amazement when he saw an opaque body of enormous dimensions blocking up the passage ! Joe , who was close upon Kennedy ’ s heels , recoiled with him . “ We are blocked in -- entrapped !” “ Impossible ! What does that mean ?--” Dick had no time to finish ; a terrific roar made him only too quickly aware what foe confronted him . “ Another lion !” exclaimed Joe . “ A lioness , rather ,” said Kennedy . “ Ah ! ferocious brute !” he added , “ I ’ ll settle you in a moment more !” and swiftly reloaded his rifle . In another instant he fired , but the animal had disappeared . “ Onward !” shouted Kennedy . “ No !” interposed the other , “ that shot did not kill her ; her body would have rolled down the steps ; she ’ s up there , ready to spring upon the first of us who appears , and he would be a lost man !” “ But what are we to do ? We must get out of this , and the doctor is expecting us .” “ Let us decoy the animal . Take my piece , and give me your rifle .” “ What is your plan ?” “ You ’ ll see .” And Joe , taking off his linen jacket , hung it on the end of the rifle , and thrust it above the top of the steps . The lioness flung herself furiously upon it . Kennedy was on the alert for her , and his bullet broke her shoulder . The lioness , with a frightful howl of agony , rolled down the steps , overturning Joe in her fall . The poor fellow imagined that he could already feel the enormous paws of the savage beast in his flesh , when a second detonation resounded in the narrow passage , and Dr . Ferguson appeared at the opening above with his gun in hand , and still smoking from the discharge . Joe leaped to his feet , clambered over the body of the dead lioness , and handed up the flask full of sparkling water to his master . To carry it to his lips , and to half empty it at a draught , was the work of an instant , and the three travellers offered up thanks from the depths of their hearts to that Providence who had so miraculously saved them .
