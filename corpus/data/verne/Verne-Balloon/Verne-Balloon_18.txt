I am sorry for it ; but , at last , we have succeeded in connecting the explorations from the east with those from the north ; and we must not complain .” The balloon was now receding gradually from the Nile . “ One last look ,” said the doctor , “ at this impassable latitude , beyond which the most intrepid travellers could not make their way . There are those intractable tribes , of whom Petherick , Arnaud , Miuni , and the young traveller Lejean , to whom we are indebted for the best work on the Upper Nile , have spoken .” “ Thus , then ,” added Kennedy , inquiringly , “ our discoveries agree with the speculations of science .” “ Absolutely so . The sources of the White Nile , of the Bahr - el - Abiad , are immersed in a lake as large as a sea ; it is there that it takes its rise . Poesy , undoubtedly , loses something thereby . People were fond of ascribing a celestial origin to this king of rivers . The ancients gave it the name of an ocean , and were not far from believing that it flowed directly from the sun ; but we must come down from these flights from time to time , and accept what science teaches us . There will not always be scientific men , perhaps ; but there always will be poets .” “ We can still see cataracts ,” said Joe . “ Those are the cataracts of Makedo , in the third degree of latitude . Nothing could be more accurate . Oh , if we could only have followed the course of the Nile for a few hours !” “ And down yonder , below us , I see the top of a mountain ,” said the hunter . “ That is Mount Longwek , the Trembling Mountain of the Arabs . This whole country was visited by Debono , who went through it under the name of Latif - Effendi . The tribes living near the Nile are hostile to each other , and are continually waging a war of extermination . You may form some idea , then , of the difficulties he had to encounter .” The wind was carrying the balloon toward the northwest , and , in order to avoid Mount Longwek , it was necessary to seek a more slanting current . “ My friends ,” said the doctor , “ here is where OUR passage of the African Continent really commences ; up to this time we have been following the traces of our predecessors . Henceforth we are to launch ourselves upon the unknown . We shall not lack the courage , shall we ?” “ Never !” said Dick and Joe together , almost in a shout . “ Onward , then , and may we have the help of Heaven !” At ten o ’ clock at night , after passing over ravines , forests , and scattered villages , the aeronauts reached the side of the Trembling Mountain , along whose gentle slopes they went quietly gliding . In that memorable day , the 23d of April , they had , in fifteen hours , impelled by a rapid breeze , traversed a distance of more than three hundred and fifteen miles . But this latter part of the journey had left them in dull spirits , and complete silence reigned in the car . Was Dr . Ferguson absorbed in the thought of his discoveries ? Were his two companions thinking of their trip through those unknown regions ? There were , no doubt , mingled with these reflections , the keenest reminiscences of home and distant friends . Joe alone continued to manifest the same careless philosophy , finding it QUITE NATURAL that home should not be there , from the moment that he left it ; but he respected the silent mood of his friends , the doctor and Kennedy . About ten the balloon anchored on the side of the Trembling Mountain , so called , because , in Arab tradition , it is said to tremble the instant that a Mussulman sets foot upon it . The travellers then partook of a substantial meal , and all quietly passed the night as usual , keeping the regular watches . On awaking the next morning , they all had pleasanter feelings . The weather was fine , and the wind was blowing from the right quarter ; so that a good breakfast , seasoned with Joe ’ s merry pranks , put them in high good - humor . The region they were now crossing is very extensive . It borders on the Mountains of the Moon on one side , and those of Darfur on the other -- a space about as broad as Europe . “ We are , no doubt , crossing what is supposed to be the kingdom of Usoga . Geographers have pretended that there existed , in the centre of Africa , a vast depression , an immense central lake . We shall see whether there is any truth in that idea ,” said the doctor . “ But how did they come to think so ?” asked Kennedy . “ From the recitals of the Arabs . Those fellows are great narrators -- too much so , probably . Some travellers , who had got as far as Kazeh , or the great lakes , saw slaves that had been brought from this region ; interrogated them concerning it , and , from their different narratives , made up a jumble of notions , and deduced systems from them . Down at the bottom of it all there is some appearance of truth ; and you see that they were right about the sources of the Nile .” “ Nothing could be more correct ,” said Kennedy . “ It was by the aid of these documents that some attempts at maps were made , and so I am going to try to follow our route by one of them , rectifying it when need be .” “ Is all this region inhabited ?” asked Joe . “ Undoubtedly ; and disagreeably inhabited , too .” “ I thought so .” “ These scattered tribes come , one and all , under the title of Nyam - Nyams , and this compound word is only a sort of nickname . It imitates the sound of chewing .” “ That ’ s it ! Excellent !” said Joe , champing his teeth as though he were eating ; “ Nyam - Nyam .” “ My good Joe , if you were the immediate object of this chewing , you wouldn ’ t find it so excellent .” “ Why , what ’ s the reason , sir ?” “ These tribes are considered man - eaters .” “ Is that really the case ?” “ Not a doubt of it ! It has also been asserted that these natives had tails , like mere quadrupeds ; but it was soon discovered that these appendages belonged to the skins of animals that they wore for clothing .” “ More ’ s the pity ! a tail ’ s a nice thing to chase away mosquitoes .” “ That may be , Joe ; but we must consign the story to the domain of fable , like the dogs ’ heads which the traveller , Brun - Rollet , attributed to other tribes .” “ Dogs ’ heads , eh ? Quite convenient for barking , and even for man - eating !” “ But one thing that has been , unfortunately , proven true , is , the ferocity of these tribes , who are really very fond of human flesh , and devour it with avidity .” “ I only hope that they won ’ t take such a particular fancy to mine !” said Joe , with comic solemnity . “ See that !” said Kennedy . “ Yes , indeed , sir ; if I have to be eaten , in a moment of famine , I want it to be for your benefit and my master ’ s ; but the idea of feeding those black fellows -- gracious ! I ’ d die of shame !” “ Well , then , Joe ,” said Kennedy , “ that ’ s understood ; we count upon you in case of need !” “ At your service , gentlemen !” “ Joe talks in this way so as to make us take good care of him , and fatten him up .” “ Maybe so !” said Joe . “ Every man for himself .” In the afternoon , the sky became covered with a warm mist , that oozed from the soil ; the brownish vapor scarcely allowed the beholder to distinguish objects , and so , fearing collision with some unexpected mountain - peak , the doctor , about five o ’ clock , gave the signal to halt . The night passed without accident , but in such profound obscurity , that it was necessary to use redoubled vigilance . The monsoon blew with extreme violence during all the next morning . The wind buried itself in the lower cavities of the balloon and shook the appendage by which the dilating - pipes entered the main apparatus . They had , at last , to be tied up with cords , Joe acquitting himself very skilfully in performing that operation . He had occasion to observe , at the same time , that the orifice of the balloon still remained hermetically sealed . “ That is a matter of double importance for us ,” said the doctor ; “ in the first place , we avoid the escape of precious gas , and then , again , we do not leave behind us an inflammable train , which we should at last inevitably set fire to , and so be consumed .” “ That would be a disagreeable travelling incident !” said Joe . “ Should we be hurled to the ground ?” asked Kennedy . “ Hurled ! No , not quite that . The gas would burn quietly , and we should descend little by little . A similar accident happened to a French aeronaut , Madame Blanchard . She ignited her balloon while sending off fireworks , but she did not fall , and she would not have been killed , probably , had not her car dashed against a chimney and precipitated her to the ground .” “ Let us hope that nothing of the kind may happen to us ,” said the hunter . “ Up to this time our trip has not seemed to me very dangerous , and I can see nothing to prevent us reaching our destination .” “ Nor can I either , my dear Dick ; accidents are generally caused by the imprudence of the aeronauts , or the defective construction of their apparatus . However , in thousands of aerial ascensions , there have not been twenty fatal accidents . Usually , the danger is in the moment of leaving the ground , or of alighting , and therefore at those junctures we should never omit the utmost precaution .” “ It ’ s breakfast - time ,” said Joe ; “ we ’ ll have to put up with preserved meat and coffee until Mr . Kennedy has had another chance to get us a good slice of venison .”
