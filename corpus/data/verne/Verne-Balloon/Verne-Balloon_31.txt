The Capital of Bornou .-- The Islands of the Biddiomahs .-- The Condors .-- The Doctor ’ s Anxieties .-- His Precautions .-- An Attack in Mid - air .-- The Balloon Covering torn .-- The Fall .-- Sublime Self - Sacrifice .-- The Northern Coast of the Lake . Since its arrival at Lake Tchad , the balloon had struck a current that edged it farther to the westward . A few clouds tempered the heat of the day , and , besides , a little air could be felt over this vast expanse of water ; but about one o ’ clock , the Victoria , having slanted across this part of the lake , again advanced over the land for a space of seven or eight miles . The doctor , who was somewhat vexed at first at this turn of his course , no longer thought of complaining when he caught sight of the city of Kouka , the capital of Bornou . He saw it for a moment , encircled by its walls of white clay , and a few rudely - constructed mosques rising clumsily above that conglomeration of houses that look like playing - dice , which form most Arab towns . In the court - yards of the private dwellings , and on the public squares , grew palms and caoutchouc - trees topped with a dome of foliage more than one hundred feet in breadth . Joe called attention to the fact that these immense parasols were in proper accordance with the intense heat of the sun , and made thereon some pious reflections which it were needless to repeat . Kouka really consists of two distinct towns , separated by the “ Dendal ,” a large boulevard three hundred yards wide , at that hour crowded with horsemen and foot passengers . On one side , the rich quarter stands squarely with its airy and lofty houses , laid out in regular order ; on the other , is huddled together the poor quarter , a miserable collection of low hovels of a conical shape , in which a poverty - stricken multitude vegetate rather than live , since Kouka is neither a trading nor a commercial city . Kennedy thought it looked something like Edinburgh , were that city extended on a plain , with its two distinct boroughs . But our travellers had scarcely the time to catch even this glimpse of it , for , with the fickleness that characterizes the air - currents of this region , a contrary wind suddenly swept them some forty miles over the surface of Lake Tchad . Then then were regaled with a new spectacle . They could count the numerous islets of the lake , inhabited by the Biddiomahs , a race of bloodthirsty and formidable pirates , who are as greatly feared when neighbors as are the Touaregs of Sahara . These estimable people were in readiness to receive the Victoria bravely with stones and arrows , but the balloon quickly passed their islands , fluttering over them , from one to the other with butterfly motion , like a gigantic beetle . At this moment , Joe , who was scanning the horizon , said to Kennedy : “ There , sir , as you are always thinking of good sport , yonder is just the thing for you !” “ What is it , Joe ?” “ This time , the doctor will not disapprove of your shooting .” “ But what is it ?” “ Don ’ t you see that flock of big birds making for us ?” “ Birds ?” exclaimed the doctor , snatching his spyglass . “ I see them ,” replied Kennedy ; “ there are at least a dozen of them .” “ Fourteen , exactly !” said Joe . “ Heaven grant that they may be of a kind sufficiently noxious for the doctor to let me peg away at them !” “ I should not object , but I would much rather see those birds at a distance from us !” “ Why , are you afraid of those fowls ?” “ They are condors , and of the largest size . Should they attack us --” “ Well , if they do , we ’ ll defend ourselves . We have a whole arsenal at our disposal . I don ’ t think those birds are so very formidable .” “ Who can tell ?” was the doctor ’ s only remark . Ten minutes later , the flock had come within gunshot , and were making the air ring with their hoarse cries . They came right toward the Victoria , more irritated than frightened by her presence . “ How they scream ! What a noise !” said Joe . “ Perhaps they don ’ t like to see anybody poaching in their country up in the air , or daring to fly like themselves !” “ Well , now , to tell the truth , when I take a good look at them , they are an ugly , ferocious set , and I should think them dangerous enough if they were armed with Purdy - Moore rifles ,” admitted Kennedy . “ They have no need of such weapons ,” said Ferguson , looking very grave . The condors flew around them in wide circles , their flight growing gradually closer and closer to the balloon . They swept through the air in rapid , fantastic curves , occasionally precipitating themselves headlong with the speed of a bullet , and then breaking their line of projection by an abrupt and daring angle . The doctor , much disquieted , resolved to ascend so as to escape this dangerous proximity . He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon , and it rapidly rose . But the condors mounted with him , apparently determined not to part company . “ They seem to mean mischief !” said the hunter , cocking his rifle . And , in fact , they were swooping nearer , and more than one came within fifty feet of them , as if defying the fire - arms . “ By George , I ’ m itching to let them have it !” exclaimed Kennedy . “ No , Dick ; not now ! Don ’ t exasperate them needlessly . That would only be exciting them to attack us !” “ But I could soon settle those fellows !” “ You may think so , Dick . But you are wrong !” “ Why , we have a bullet for each of them !” “ And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon , what would you do ? How would you get at them ? Just imagine yourself in the presence of a troop of lions on the plain , or a school of sharks in the open ocean ! For travellers in the air , this situation is just as dangerous .” “ Are you speaking seriously , doctor ?” “ Very seriously , Dick .” “ Let us wait , then !” “ Wait ! Hold yourself in readiness in case of an attack , but do not fire without my orders .” The birds then collected at a short distance , yet to near that their naked necks , entirely bare of feathers , could be plainly seen , as they stretched them out with the effort of their cries , while their gristly crests , garnished with a comb and gills of deep violet , stood erect with rage . They were of the very largest size , their bodies being more than three feet in length , and the lower surface of their white wings glittering in the sunlight . They might well have been considered winged sharks , so striking was their resemblance to those ferocious rangers of the deep . “ They are following us !” said the doctor , as he saw them ascending with him , “ and , mount as we may , they can fly still higher !” “ Well , what are we to do ?” asked Kennedy . The doctor made no answer . “ Listen , Samuel !” said the sportsman . “ There are fourteen of those birds ; we have seventeen shots at our disposal if we discharge all our weapons . Have we not the means , then , to destroy them or disperse them ? I will give a good account of some of them !” “ I have no doubt of your skill , Dick ; I look upon all as dead that may come within range of your rifle , but I repeat that , if they attack the upper part of the balloon , you could not get a sight at them . They would tear the silk covering that sustains us , and we are three thousand feet up in the air !” At this moment , one of the ferocious birds darted right at the balloon , with outstretched beak and claws , ready to rend it with either or both . “ Fire ! fire at once !” cried the doctor . He had scarcely ceased , ere the huge creature , stricken dead , dropped headlong , turning over and over in space as he fell . Kennedy had already grasped one of the two - barrelled fowling - pieces and Joe was taking aim with another . Frightened by the report , the condors drew back for a moment , but they almost instantly returned to the charge with extreme fury . Kennedy severed the head of one from its body with his first shot , and Joe broke the wing of another . “ Only eleven left ,” said he . Thereupon the birds changed their tactics , and by common consent soared above the balloon . Kennedy glanced at Ferguson . The latter , in spite of his imperturbability , grew pale . Then ensued a moment of terrifying silence . In the next they heard a harsh tearing noise , as of something rending the silk , and the car seemed to sink from beneath the feet of our three aeronauts . “ We are lost !” exclaimed Ferguson , glancing at the barometer , which was now swiftly rising . “ Over with the ballast !” he shouted , “ over with it !” And in a few seconds the last lumps of quartz had disappeared . “ We are still falling ! Empty the water - tanks ! Do you hear me , Joe ? We are pitching into the lake !” Joe obeyed . The doctor leaned over and looked out . The lake seemed to come up toward him like a rising tide . Every object around grew rapidly in size while they were looking at it . The car was not two hundred feet from the surface of Lake Tchad . “ The provisions ! the provisions !” cried the doctor . And the box containing them was launched into space . Their descent became less rapid , but the luckless aeronauts were still falling , and into the lake . “ Throw out something -- something more !” cried the doctor . “ There is nothing more to throw !” was Kennedy ’ s despairing response . “ Yes , there is !” called Joe , and with a wave of the hand he disappeared like a flash , over the edge of the car . “ Joe ! Joe !” exclaimed the doctor , horror - stricken . The Victoria thus relieved resumed her ascending motion , mounted a thousand feet into the air , and the wind , burying itself in the disinflated covering , bore them away toward the northern part of the lake . “ Lost !” exclaimed the sportsman , with a gesture of despair . “ Lost to save us !” responded Ferguson . And these men , intrepid as they were , felt the large tears streaming down their cheeks . They leaned over with the vain hope of seeing some trace of their heroic companion , but they were already far away from him . “ What course shall we pursue ?” asked Kennedy . “ Alight as soon as possible , Dick , and then wait .” After a sweep of some sixty miles the Victoria halted on a desert shore , on the north of the lake . The anchors caught in a low tree and the sportsman fastened it securely . Night came , but neither Ferguson nor Kennedy could find one moment ’ s sleep .
