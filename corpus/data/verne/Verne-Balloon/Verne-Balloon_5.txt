A Servant -- match him !-- He can see the Satellites of Jupiter .-- Dick and Joe hard at it .-- Doubt and Faith .-- The Weighing Ceremony .-- Joe and Wellington .-- He gets a Half - crown . Dr . Ferguson had a servant who answered with alacrity to the name of Joe . He was an excellent fellow , who testified the most absolute confidence in his master , and the most unlimited devotion to his interests , even anticipating his wishes and orders , which were always intelligently executed . In fine , he was a Caleb without the growling , and a perfect pattern of constant good - humor . Had he been made on purpose for the place , it could not have been better done . Ferguson put himself entirely in his hands , so far as the ordinary details of existence were concerned , and he did well . Incomparable , whole - souled Joe ! a servant who orders your dinner ; who likes what you like ; who packs your trunk , without forgetting your socks or your linen ; who has charge of your keys and your secrets , and takes no advantage of all this ! But then , what a man the doctor was in the eyes of this worthy Joe ! With what respect and what confidence the latter received all his decisions ! When Ferguson had spoken , he would be a fool who should attempt to question the matter . Every thing he thought was exactly right ; every thing he said , the perfection of wisdom ; every thing he ordered to be done , quite feasible ; all that he undertook , practicable ; all that he accomplished , admirable . You might have cut Joe to pieces -- not an agreeable operation , to be sure -- and yet he would not have altered his opinion of his master . So , when the doctor conceived the project of crossing Africa through the air , for Joe the thing was already done ; obstacles no longer existed ; from the moment when the doctor had made up his mind to start , he had arrived -- along with his faithful attendant , too , for the noble fellow knew , without a word uttered about it , that he would be one of the party . Moreover , he was just the man to render the greatest service by his intelligence and his wonderful agility . Had the occasion arisen to name a professor of gymnastics for the monkeys in the Zoological Garden ( who are smart enough , by - the - way ! ), Joe would certainly have received the appointment . Leaping , climbing , almost flying -- these were all sport to him . If Ferguson was the head and Kennedy the arm , Joe was to be the right hand of the expedition . He had , already , accompanied his master on several journeys , and had a smattering of science appropriate to his condition and style of mind , but he was especially remarkable for a sort of mild philosophy , a charming turn of optimism . In his sight every thing was easy , logical , natural , and , consequently , he could see no use in complaining or grumbling . Among other gifts , he possessed a strength and range of vision that were perfectly surprising . He enjoyed , in common with Moestlin , Kepler ’ s professor , the rare faculty of distinguishing the satellites of Jupiter with the naked eye , and of counting fourteen of the stars in the group of Pleiades , the remotest of them being only of the ninth magnitude . He presumed none the more for that ; on the contrary , he made his bow to you , at a distance , and when occasion arose he bravely knew how to use his eyes . With such profound faith as Joe felt in the doctor , it is not to be wondered at that incessant discussions sprang up between him and Kennedy , without any lack of respect to the latter , however . One doubted , the other believed ; one had a prudent foresight , the other blind confidence . The doctor , however , vibrated between doubt and confidence ; that is to say , he troubled his head with neither one nor the other . “ Well , Mr . Kennedy ,” Joe would say . “ Well , my boy ?” “ The moment ’ s at hand . It seems that we are to sail for the moon .” “ You mean the Mountains of the Moon , which are not quite so far off . But , never mind , one trip is just as dangerous as the other !” “ Dangerous ! What ! with a man like Dr . Ferguson ?” “ I don ’ t want to spoil your illusions , my good Joe ; but this undertaking of his is nothing more nor less than the act of a madman . He won ’ t go , though !” “ He won ’ t go , eh ? Then you haven ’ t seen his balloon at Mitchell ’ s factory in the Borough ?” “ I ’ ll take precious good care to keep away from it !” “ Well , you ’ ll lose a fine sight , sir . What a splendid thing it is ! What a pretty shape ! What a nice car ! How snug we ’ ll feel in it !” “ Then you really think of going with your master ?” “ I ?” answered Joe , with an accent of profound conviction . “ Why , I ’ d go with him wherever he pleases ! Who ever heard of such a thing ? Leave him to go off alone , after we ’ ve been all over the world together ! Who would help him , when he was tired ? Who would give him a hand in climbing over the rocks ? Who would attend him when he was sick ? No , Mr . Kennedy , Joe will always stick to the doctor !” “ You ’ re a fine fellow , Joe !” “ But , then , you ’ re coming with us !” “ Oh ! certainly ,” said Kennedy ; “ that is to say , I will go with you up to the last moment , to prevent Samuel even then from being guilty of such an act of folly ! I will follow him as far as Zanzibar , so as to stop him there , if possible .” “ You ’ ll stop nothing at all , Mr . Kennedy , with all respect to you , sir . My master is no hare - brained person ; he takes a long time to think over what he means to do , and then , when he once gets started , the Evil One himself couldn ’ t make him give it up .” “ Well , we ’ ll see about that .” “ Don ’ t flatter yourself , sir -- but then , the main thing is , to have you with us . For a hunter like you , sir , Africa ’ s a great country . So , either way , you won ’ t be sorry for the trip .” “ No , that ’ s a fact , I shan ’ t be sorry for it , if I can get this crazy man to give up his scheme .” “ By - the - way ,” said Joe , “ you know that the weighing comes off to - day .” “ The weighing -- what weighing ?” “ Why , my master , and you , and I , are all to be weighed to - day !” “ What ! like horse - jockeys ?” “ Yes , like jockeys . Only , never fear , you won ’ t be expected to make yourself lean , if you ’ re found to be heavy . You ’ ll go as you are .” “ Well , I can tell you , I am not going to let myself be weighed ,” said Kennedy , firmly . “ But , sir , it seems that the doctor ’ s machine requires it .” “ Well , his machine will have to do without it .” “ Humph ! and suppose that it couldn ’ t go up , then ?” “ Egad ! that ’ s all I want !” “ Come ! come , Mr . Kennedy ! My master will be sending for us directly .” “ I shan ’ t go .” “ Oh ! now , you won ’ t vex the doctor in that way !” “ Aye ! that I will .” “ Well !” said Joe with a laugh , “ you say that because he ’ s not here ; but when he says to your face , ‘ Dick !’ ( with all respect to you , sir ,) ‘ Dick , I want to know exactly how much you weigh ,’ you ’ ll go , I warrant it .” “ No , I will NOT go !” At this moment the doctor entered his study , where this discussion had been taking place ; and , as he came in , cast a glance at Kennedy , who did not feel altogether at his ease . “ Dick ,” said the doctor , “ come with Joe ; I want to know how much you both weigh .” “ But --” “ You may keep your hat on . Come !” And Kennedy went . They repaired in company to the workshop of the Messrs . Mitchell , where one of those so - called “ Roman ” scales was in readiness . It was necessary , by the way , for the doctor to know the weight of his companions , so as to fix the equilibrium of his balloon ; so he made Dick get up on the platform of the scales . The latter , without making any resistance , said , in an undertone : “ Oh ! well , that doesn ’ t bind me to any thing .” “ One hundred and fifty - three pounds ,” said the doctor , noting it down on his tablets . “ Am I too heavy ?” “ Why , no , Mr . Kennedy !” said Joe ; “ and then , you know , I am light to make up for it .” So saying , Joe , with enthusiasm , took his place on the scales , and very nearly upset them in his ready haste . He struck the attitude of Wellington where he is made to ape Achilles , at Hyde - Park entrance , and was superb in it , without the shield . “ One hundred and twenty pounds ,” wrote the doctor . “ Ah ! ha !” said Joe , with a smile of satisfaction And why did he smile ? He never could tell himself . “ It ’ s my turn now ,” said Ferguson -- and he put down one hundred and thirty - five pounds to his own account . “ All three of us ,” said he , “ do not weigh much more than four hundred pounds .” “ But , sir ,” said Joe , “ if it was necessary for your expedition , I could make myself thinner by twenty pounds , by not eating so much .” “ Useless , my boy !” replied the doctor . “ You may eat as much as you like , and here ’ s half - a - crown to buy you the ballast .”
