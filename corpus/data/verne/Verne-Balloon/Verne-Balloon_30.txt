Departure in the Night - time .-- All Three .-- Kennedy ’ s Instincts .-- Precautions .-- The Course of the Shari River .-- Lake Tchad .-- The Water of the Lake .-- The Hippopotamus .-- One Bullet thrown away . About three o ’ clock in the morning , Joe , who was then on watch , at length saw the city move away from beneath his feet . The Victoria was once again in motion , and both the doctor and Kennedy awoke . The former consulted his compass , and saw , with satisfaction , that the wind was carrying them toward the north - northeast . “ We are in luck !” said he ; “ every thing works in our favor : we shall discover Lake Tchad this very day .” “ Is it a broad sheet of water ?” asked Kennedy . “ Somewhat , Dick . At its greatest length and breadth , it measures about one hundred and twenty miles .” “ It will spice our trip with a little variety to sail over a spacious sheet of water .” “ After all , though , I don ’ t see that we have much to complain of on that score . Our trip has been very much varied , indeed ; and , moreover , we are getting on under the best possible conditions .” “ Unquestionably so ; excepting those privations on the desert , we have encountered no serious danger .” “ It is not to be denied that our noble balloon has behaved wonderfully well . To - day is May 12th , and we started on the 18th of April . That makes twenty - five days of journeying . In ten days more we shall have reached our destination .” “ Where is that ?” “ I do not know . But what does that signify ?” “ You are right again , Samuel ! Let us intrust to Providence the care of guiding us and of keeping us in good health as we are now . We don ’ t look much as though we had been crossing the most pestilential country in the world !” “ We had an opportunity of getting up in life , and that ’ s what we have done !” “ Hurrah for trips in the air !” cried Joe . “ Here we are at the end of twenty - five days in good condition , well fed , and well rested . We ’ ve had too much rest in fact , for my legs begin to feel rusty , and I wouldn ’ t be vexed a bit to stretch them with a run of thirty miles or so !” “ You can do that , Joe , in the streets of London , but in fine we set out three together , like Denham , Clapperton , and Overweg ; like Barth , Richardson , and Vogel , and , more fortunate than our predecessors here , we are three in number still . But it is most important for us not to separate . If , while one of us was on the ground , the Victoria should have to ascend in order to escape some sudden danger , who knows whether we should ever see each other again ? Therefore it is that I say again to Kennedy frankly that I do not like his going off alone to hunt .” “ But still , Samuel , you will permit me to indulge that fancy a little . There is no harm in renewing our stock of provisions . Besides , before our departure , you held out to me the prospect of some superb hunting , and thus far I have done but little in the line of the Andersons and Cummings .” “ But , my dear Dick , your memory fails you , or your modesty makes you forget your own exploits . It really seems to me that , without mentioning small game , you have already an antelope , an elephant , and two lions on your conscience .” “ But what ’ s all that to an African sportsman who sees all the animals in creation strutting along under the muzzle of his rifle ? There ! there ! look at that troop of giraffes !” “ Those giraffes ,” roared Joe ; “ why , they ’ re not as big as my fist .” “ Because we are a thousand feet above them ; but close to them you would discover that they are three times as tall as you are !” “ And what do you say to yon herd of gazelles , and those ostriches , that run with the speed of the wind ?” resumed Kennedy . “ Those ostriches ?” remonstrated Joe , again ; “ those are chickens , and the greatest kind of chickens !” “ Come , doctor , can ’ t we get down nearer to them ?” pleaded Kennedy . “ We can get closer to them , Dick , but we must not land . And what good will it do you to strike down those poor animals when they can be of no use to you ? Now , if the question were to destroy a lion , a tiger , a cat , a hyena , I could understand it ; but to deprive an antelope or a gazelle of life , to no other purpose than the gratification of your instincts as a sportsman , seems hardly worth the trouble . But , after all , my friend , we are going to keep at about one hundred feet only from the soil , and , should you see any ferocious wild beast , oblige us by sending a ball through its heart !” The Victoria descended gradually , but still keeping at a safe height , for , in a barbarous , yet very populous country , it was necessary to keep on the watch for unexpected perils . The travellers were then directly following the course of the Shari . The charming banks of this river were hidden beneath the foliage of trees of various dyes ; lianas and climbing plants wound in and out on all sides and formed the most curious combinations of color . Crocodiles were seen basking in the broad blaze of the sun or plunging beneath the waters with the agility of lizards , and in their gambols they sported about among the many green islands that intercept the current of the stream . It was thus , in the midst of rich and verdant landscapes that our travellers passed over the district of Maffatay , and about nine o ’ clock in the morning reached the southern shore of Lake Tchad . There it was at last , outstretched before them , that Caspian Sea of Africa , the existence of which was so long consigned to the realms of fable -- that interior expanse of water to which only Denham ’ s and Barth ’ s expeditions had been able to force their way . The doctor strove in vain to fix its precise configuration upon paper . It had already changed greatly since 1847 . In fact , the chart of Lake Tchad is very difficult to trace with exactitude , for it is surrounded by muddy and almost impassable morasses , in which Barth thought that he was doomed to perish . From year to year these marshes , covered with reeds and papyrus fifteen feet high , become the lake itself . Frequently , too , the villages on its shores are half submerged , as was the case with Ngornou in 1856 , and now the hippopotamus and the alligator frisk and dive where the dwellings of Bornou once stood . The sun shot his dazzling rays over this placid sheet of water , and toward the north the two elements merged into one and the same horizon . The doctor was desirous of determining the character of the water , which was long believed to be salt . There was no danger in descending close to the lake , and the car was soon skimming its surface like a bird at the distance of only five feet . Joe plunged a bottle into the lake and drew it up half filled . The water was then tasted and found to be but little fit for drinking , with a certain carbonate - of - soda flavor . While the doctor was jotting down the result of this experiment , the loud report of a gun was heard close beside him . Kennedy had not been able to resist the temptation of firing at a huge hippopotamus . The latter , who had been basking quietly , disappeared at the sound of the explosion , but did not seem to be otherwise incommoded by Kennedy ’ s conical bullet . “ You ’ d have done better if you had harpooned him ,” said Joe . “ But how ?” “ With one of our anchors . It would have been a hook just big enough for such a rousing beast as that !” “ Humph !” ejaculated Kennedy , “ Joe really has an idea this time --” “ Which I beg of you not to put into execution ,” interposed the doctor . “ The animal would very quickly have dragged us where we could not have done much to help ourselves , and where we have no business to be .” “ Especially now since we ’ ve settled the question as to what kind of water there is in Lake Tchad . Is that sort of fish good to eat , Dr . Ferguson ?” “ That fish , as you call it , Joe , is really a mammiferous animal of the pachydermal species . Its flesh is said to be excellent and is an article of important trade between the tribes living along the borders of the lake .” “ Then I ’ m sorry that Mr . Kennedy ’ s shot didn ’ t do more damage .” “ The animal is vulnerable only in the stomach and between the thighs . Dick ’ s ball hasn ’ t even marked him ; but should the ground strike me as favorable , we shall halt at the northern end of the lake , where Kennedy will find himself in the midst of a whole menagerie , and can make up for lost time .” “ Well ,” said Joe , “ I hope then that Mr . Kennedy will hunt the hippopotamus a little ; I ’ d like to taste the meat of that queer - looking beast . It doesn ’ t look exactly natural to get away into the centre of Africa , to feed on snipe and partridge , just as if we were in England .”
