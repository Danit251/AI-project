Joe in a Fit of Rage .-- The Death of a Good Man .-- The Night of watching by the Body .-- Barrenness and Drought .-- The Burial .-- The Quartz Rocks .-- Joe ’ s Hallucinations .-- A Precious Ballast .-- A Survey of the Gold - bearing Mountains .-- The Beginning of Joe ’ s Despair . A magnificent night overspread the earth , and the missionary lay quietly asleep in utter exhaustion . “ He ’ ll not get over it !” sighed Joe . “ Poor young fellow -- scarcely thirty years of age !” “ He ’ ll die in our arms . His breathing , which was so feeble before , is growing weaker still , and I can do nothing to save him ,” said the doctor , despairingly . “ The infamous scoundrels !” exclaimed Joe , grinding his teeth , in one of those fits of rage that came over him at long intervals ; “ and to think that , in spite of all , this good man could find words only to pity them , to excuse , to pardon them !” “ Heaven has given him a lovely night , Joe -- his last on earth , perhaps ! He will suffer but little more after this , and his dying will be only a peaceful falling asleep .” The dying man uttered some broken words , and the doctor at once went to him . His breathing became difficult , and he asked for air . The curtains were drawn entirely back , and he inhaled with rapture the light breezes of that clear , beautiful night . The stars sent him their trembling rays , and the moon wrapped him in the white winding - sheet of its effulgence . “ My friends ,” said he , in an enfeebled voice , “ I am going . May God requite you , and bring you to your safe harbor ! May he pay for me the debt of gratitude that I owe to you !” “ You must still hope ,” replied Kennedy . “ This is but a passing fit of weakness . You will not die . How could any one die on this beautiful summer night ?” “ Death is at hand ,” replied the missionary , “ I know it ! Let me look it in the face ! Death , the commencement of things eternal , is but the end of earthly cares . Place me upon my knees , my brethren , I beseech you !” Kennedy lifted him up , and it was distressing to see his weakened limbs bend under him . “ My God ! my God !” exclaimed the dying apostle , “ have pity on me !” His countenance shone . Far above that earth on which he had known no joys ; in the midst of that night which sent to him its softest radiance ; on the way to that heaven toward which he uplifted his spirit , as though in a miraculous assumption , he seemed already to live and breathe in the new existence . His last gesture was a supreme blessing on his new friends of only one day . Then he fell back into the arms of Kennedy , whose countenance was bathed in hot tears . “ Dead !” said the doctor , bending over him , “ dead !” And with one common accord , the three friends knelt together in silent prayer . “ To - morrow ,” resumed the doctor , “ we shall bury him in the African soil which he has besprinkled with his blood .” During the rest of the night the body was watched , turn by turn , by the three travellers , and not a word disturbed the solemn silence . Each of them was weeping . The next day the wind came from the south , and the balloon moved slowly over a vast plateau of mountains : there , were extinct craters ; here , barren ravines ; not a drop of water on those parched crests ; piles of broken rocks ; huge stony masses scattered hither and thither , and , interspersed with whitish marl , all indicated the most complete sterility . Toward noon , the doctor , for the purpose of burying the body , decided to descend into a ravine , in the midst of some plutonic rocks of primitive formation . The surrounding mountains would shelter him , and enable him to bring his car to the ground , for there was no tree in sight to which he could make it fast . But , as he had explained to Kennedy , it was now impossible for him to descend , except by releasing a quantity of gas proportionate to his loss of ballast at the time when he had rescued the missionary . He therefore opened the valve of the outside balloon . The hydrogen escaped , and the Victoria quietly descended into the ravine . As soon as the car touched the ground , the doctor shut the valve . Joe leaped out , holding on the while to the rim of the car with one hand , and with the other gathering up a quantity of stones equal to his own weight . He could then use both hands , and had soon heaped into the car more than five hundred pounds of stones , which enabled both the doctor and Kennedy , in their turn , to get out . Thus the Victoria found herself balanced , and her ascensional force insufficient to raise her . Moreover , it was not necessary to gather many of these stones , for the blocks were extremely heavy , so much so , indeed , that the doctor ’ s attention was attracted by the circumstance . The soil , in fact , was bestrewn with quartz and porphyritic rocks . “ This is a singular discovery !” said the doctor , mentally . In the mean while , Kennedy and Joe had strolled away a few paces , looking up a proper spot for the grave . The heat was extreme in this ravine , shut in as it was like a sort of furnace . The noonday sun poured down its rays perpendicularly into it . The first thing to be done was to clear the surface of the fragments of rock that encumbered it , and then a quite deep grave had to be dug , so that the wild animals should not be able to disinter the corpse . The body of the martyred missionary was then solemnly placed in it . The earth was thrown in over his remains , and above it masses of rock were deposited , in rude resemblance to a tomb . The doctor , however , remained motionless , and lost in his reflections . He did not even heed the call of his companions , nor did he return with them to seek a shelter from the heat of the day . “ What are you thinking about , doctor ?” asked Kennedy . “ About a singular freak of Nature , a curious effect of chance . Do you know , now , in what kind of soil that man of self - denial , that poor one in spirit , has just been buried ?” “ No ! what do you mean , doctor ?” “ That priest , who took the oath of perpetual poverty , now reposes in a gold - mine !” “ A gold - mine !” exclaimed Kennedy and Joe in one breath . “ Yes , a gold - mine ,” said the doctor , quietly . “ Those blocks which you are trampling under foot , like worthless stones , contain gold - ore of great purity .” “ Impossible ! impossible !” repeated Joe . “ You would not have to look long among those fissures of slaty schist without finding peptites of considerable value .” Joe at once rushed like a crazy man among the scattered fragments , and Kennedy was not long in following his example . “ Keep cool , Joe ,” said his master . “ Why , doctor , you speak of the thing quite at your ease .” “ What ! a philosopher of your mettle --” “ Ah , master , no philosophy holds good in this case !” “ Come ! come ! Let us reflect a little . What good would all this wealth do you ? We cannot carry any of it away with us .” “ We can ’ t take any of it with us , indeed ?” “ It ’ s rather too heavy for our car ! I even hesitated to tell you any thing about it , for fear of exciting your regret !” “ What !” said Joe , again , “ abandon these treasures -- a fortune for us !-- really for us -- our own -- leave it behind !” “ Take care , my friend ! Would you yield to the thirst for gold ? Has not this dead man whom you have just helped to bury , taught you the vanity of human affairs ?” “ All that is true ,” replied Joe , “ but gold ! Mr . Kennedy , won ’ t you help to gather up a trifle of all these millions ?” “ What could we do with them , Joe ?” said the hunter , unable to repress a smile . “ We did not come hither in search of fortune , and we cannot take one home with us .” “ The millions are rather heavy , you know ,” resumed the doctor , “ and cannot very easily be put into one ’ s pocket .” “ But , at least ,” said Joe , driven to his last defences , “ couldn ’ t we take some of that ore for ballast , instead of sand ?” “ Very good ! I consent ,” said the doctor , “ but you must not make too many wry faces when we come to throw some thousands of crowns ’ worth overboard .” “ Thousands of crowns !” echoed Joe ; “ is it possible that there is so much gold in them , and that all this is the same ?” “ Yes , my friend , this is a reservoir in which Nature has been heaping up her wealth for centuries ! There is enough here to enrich whole nations ! An Australia and a California both together in the midst of the wilderness !” “ And the whole of it is to remain useless !” “ Perhaps ! but at all events , here ’ s what I ’ ll do to console you .” “ That would be rather difficult to do !” said Joe , with a contrite air . “ Listen ! I will take the exact bearings of this spot , and give them to you , so that , upon your return to England , you can tell our countrymen about it , and let them have a share , if you think that so much gold would make them happy .” “ Ah ! master , I give up ; I see that you are right , and that there is nothing else to be done . Let us fill our car with the precious mineral , and what remains at the end of the trip will be so much made .” And Joe went to work . He did so , too , with all his might , and soon had collected more than a thousand pieces of quartz , which contained gold enclosed as though in an extremely hard crystal casket . The doctor watched him with a smile ; and , while Joe went on , he took the bearings , and found that the missionary ’ s grave lay in twenty - two degrees twenty - three minutes east longitude , and four degrees fifty - five minutes north latitude . Then , casting one glance at the swelling of the soil , beneath which the body of the poor Frenchman reposed , he went back to his car . He would have erected a plain , rude cross over the tomb , left solitary thus in the midst of the African deserts , but not a tree was to be seen in the environs . “ God will recognize it !” said Kennedy . An anxiety of another sort now began to steal over the doctor ’ s mind . He would have given much of the gold before him for a little water -- for he had to replace what had been thrown overboard when the negro was carried up into the air . But it was impossible to find it in these arid regions ; and this reflection gave him great uneasiness . He had to feed his cylinder continually ; and he even began to find that he had not enough to quench the thirst of his party . Therefore he determined to lose no opportunity of replenishing his supply . Upon getting back to the car , he found it burdened with the quartz - blocks that Joe ’ s greed had heaped in it . He got in , however , without saying any thing . Kennedy took his customary place , and Joe followed , but not without casting a covetous glance at the treasures in the ravine . The doctor rekindled the light in the cylinder ; the spiral became heated ; the current of hydrogen came in a few minutes , and the gas dilated ; but the balloon did not stir an inch . Joe looked on uneasily , but kept silent . “ Joe !” said the doctor . Joe made no reply . “ Joe ! Don ’ t you hear me ?” Joe made a sign that he heard ; but he would not understand . “ Do me the kindness to throw out some of that quartz !” “ But , doctor , you gave me leave --” “ I gave you leave to replace the ballast ; that was all !” “ But --” “ Do you want to stay forever in this desert ?” Joe cast a despairing look at Kennedy ; but the hunter put on the air of a man who could do nothing in the matter . “ Well , Joe ?” “ Then your cylinder don ’ t work ,” said the obstinate fellow . “ My cylinder ? It is lit , as you perceive . But the balloon will not rise until you have thrown off a little ballast .” Joe scratched his ear , picked up a piece of quartz , the smallest in the lot , weighed and reweighed it , and tossed it up and down in his hand . It was a fragment of about three or four pounds . At last he threw it out . But the balloon did not budge . “ Humph !” said he ; “ we ’ re not going up yet .” “ Not yet ,” said the doctor . “ Keep on throwing .” Kennedy laughed . Joe now threw out some ten pounds , but the balloon stood still . Joe got very pale . “ Poor fellow !” said the doctor . “ Mr . Kennedy , you and I weigh , unless I am mistaken , about four hundred pounds -- so that you ’ ll have to get rid of at least that weight , since it was put in here to make up for us .” “ Throw away four hundred pounds !” said Joe , piteously . “ And some more with it , or we can ’ t rise . Come , courage , Joe !” The brave fellow , heaving deep sighs , began at last to lighten the balloon ; but , from time to time , he would stop , and ask : “ Are you going up ?” “ No , not yet ,” was the invariable response . “ It moves !” said he , at last . “ Keep on !” replied the doctor . “ It ’ s going up ; I ’ m sure .” “ Keep on yet ,” said Kennedy . And Joe , picking up one more block , desperately tossed it out of the car . The balloon rose a hundred feet or so , and , aided by the cylinder , soon passed above the surrounding summits . “ Now , Joe ,” resumed the doctor , “ there still remains a handsome fortune for you ; and , if we can only keep the rest of this with us until the end of our trip , there you are -- rich for the balance of your days !” Joe made no answer , but stretched himself out luxuriously on his heap of quartz . “ See , my dear Dick !” the doctor went on . “ Just see the power of this metal over the cleverest lad in the world ! What passions , what greed , what crimes , the knowledge of such a mine as that would cause ! It is sad to think of it !” By evening the balloon had made ninety miles to the westward , and was , in a direct line , fourteen hundred miles from Zanzibar .
