The Mountains of the Moon .-- An Ocean of Verdure .-- They cast Anchor .-- The Towing Elephant .-- A Running Fire .-- Death of the Monster .-- The Field - Oven .-- A Meal on the Grass .-- A Night on the Ground . About four in the morning , Monday , the sun reappeared in the horizon ; the clouds had dispersed , and a cheery breeze refreshed the morning dawn . The earth , all redolent with fragrant exhalations , reappeared to the gaze of our travellers . The balloon , whirled about by opposing currents , had hardly budged from its place , and the doctor , letting the gas contract , descended so as to get a more northerly direction . For a long while his quest was fruitless ; the wind carried him toward the west until he came in sight of the famous Mountains of the Moon , which grouped themselves in a semicircle around the extremity of Lake Tanganayika ; their ridges , but slightly indented , stood out against the bluish horizon , so that they might have been mistaken for a natural fortification , not to be passed by the explorers of the centre of Africa . Among them were a few isolated cones , revealing the mark of the eternal snows . “ Here we are at last ,” said the doctor , “ in an unexplored country ! Captain Burton pushed very far to the westward , but he could not reach those celebrated mountains ; he even denied their existence , strongly as it was affirmed by Speke , his companion . He pretended that they were born in the latter ’ s fancy ; but for us , my friends , there is no further doubt possible .” “ Shall we cross them ?” asked Kennedy . “ Not , if it please God . I am looking for a wind that will take me back toward the equator . I will even wait for one , if necessary , and will make the balloon like a ship that casts anchor , until favorable breezes come up .” But the foresight of the doctor was not long in bringing its reward ; for , after having tried different heights , the Victoria at length began to sail off to the northeastward with medium speed . “ We are in the right track ,” said the doctor , consulting his compass , “ and scarcely two hundred feet from the surface ; lucky circumstances for us , enabling us , as they do , to reconnoitre these new regions . When Captain Speke set out to discover Lake Ukereoue , he ascended more to the eastward in a straight line above Kazeh .” “ Shall we keep on long in this way ?” inquired the Scot . “ Perhaps . Our object is to push a point in the direction of the sources of the Nile ; and we have more than six hundred miles to make before we get to the extreme limit reached by the explorers who came from the north .” “ And we shan ’ t set foot on the solid ground ?” murmured Joe ; “ it ’ s enough to cramp a fellow ’ s legs !” “ Oh , yes , indeed , my good Joe ,” said the doctor , reassuring him ; “ we have to economize our provisions , you know ; and on the way , Dick , you must get us some fresh meat .” “ Whenever you like , doctor .” “ We shall also have to replenish our stock of water . Who knows but we may be carried to some of the dried - up regions ? So we cannot take too many precautions .” At noon the Victoria was at twenty - nine degrees fifteen minutes east longitude , and three degrees fifteen minutes south latitude . She passed the village of Uyofu , the last northern limit of the Unyamwezi , opposite to the Lake Ukereoue , which could still be seen . The tribes living near to the equator seem to be a little more civilized , and are governed by absolute monarchs , whose control is an unlimited despotism . Their most compact union of power constitutes the province of Karagwah . It was decided by the aeronauts that they would alight at the first favorable place . They found that they should have to make a prolonged halt , and take a careful inspection of the balloon : so the flame of the cylinder was moderated , and the anchors , flung out from the car , ere long began to sweep the grass of an immense prairie , that , from a certain height , looked like a shaven lawn , but the growth of which , in reality , was from seven to eight feet in height . The balloon skimmed this tall grass without bending it , like a gigantic butterfly : not an obstacle was in sight ; it was an ocean of verdure without a single breaker . “ We might proceed a long time in this style ,” remarked Kennedy ; “ I don ’ t see one tree that we could approach , and I ’ m afraid that our hunt ’ s over .” “ Wait , Dick ; you could not hunt anyhow in this grass , that grows higher than your head . We ’ ll find a favorable place presently .” In truth , it was a charming excursion that they were making now -- a veritable navigation on this green , almost transparent sea , gently undulating in the breath of the wind . The little car seemed to cleave the waves of verdure , and , from time to time , coveys of birds of magnificent plumage would rise fluttering from the tall herbage , and speed away with joyous cries . The anchors plunged into this lake of flowers , and traced a furrow that closed behind them , like the wake of a ship . All at once a sharp shock was felt -- the anchor had caught in the fissure of some rock hidden in the high grass . “ We are fast !” exclaimed Joe . These words had scarcely been uttered when a shrill cry rang through the air , and the following phrases , mingled with exclamations , escaped from the lips of our travellers : “ What ’ s that ?” “ A strange cry !” “ Look ! Why , we ’ re moving !” “ The anchor has slipped !” “ No ; it holds , and holds fast too !” said Joe , who was tugging at the rope . “ It ’ s the rock , then , that ’ s moving !” An immense rustling was noticed in the grass , and soon an elongated , winding shape was seen rising above it . “ A serpent !” shouted Joe . “ A serpent !” repeated Kennedy , handling his rifle . “ No ,” said the doctor , “ it ’ s an elephant ’ s trunk !” “ An elephant , Samuel ?” And , as Kennedy said this , he drew his rifle to his shoulder . “ Wait , Dick ; wait !” “ That ’ s a fact ! The animal ’ s towing us !” “ And in the right direction , Joe -- in the right direction .” The elephant was now making some headway , and soon reached a clearing where his whole body could be seen . By his gigantic size , the doctor recognized a male of a superb species . He had two whitish tusks , beautifully curved , and about eight feet in length ; and in these the shanks of the anchor had firmly caught . The animal was vainly trying with his trunk to disengage himself from the rope that attached him to the car . “ Get up -- go ahead , old fellow !” shouted Joe , with delight , doing his best to urge this rather novel team . “ Here is a new style of travelling !-- no more horses for me . An elephant , if you please !” “ But where is he taking us to ?” said Kennedy , whose rifle itched in his grasp . “ He ’ s taking us exactly to where we want to go , my dear Dick . A little patience !” “‘ Wig - a - more ! wig - a - more !’ as the Scotch country folks say ,” shouted Joe , in high glee . “ Gee - up ! gee - up there !” The huge animal now broke into a very rapid gallop . He flung his trunk from side to side , and his monstrous bounds gave the car several rather heavy thumps . Meanwhile the doctor stood ready , hatchet in hand , to cut the rope , should need arise . “ But ,” said he , “ we shall not give up our anchor until the last moment .” This drive , with an elephant for the team , lasted about an hour and a half ; yet the animal did not seem in the least fatigued . These immense creatures can go over a great deal of ground , and , from one day to another , are found at enormous distances from there they were last seen , like the whales , whose mass and speed they rival . “ In fact ,” said Joe , “ it ’ s a whale that we have harpooned ; and we ’ re only doing just what whalemen do when out fishing .” But a change in the nature of the ground compelled the doctor to vary his style of locomotion . A dense grove of calmadores was descried on the horizon , about three miles away , on the north of the prairie . So it became necessary to detach the balloon from its draught - animal at last . Kennedy was intrusted with the job of bringing the elephant to a halt . He drew his rifle to his shoulder , but his position was not favorable to a successful shot ; so that the first ball fired flattened itself on the animal ’ s skull , as it would have done against an iron plate . The creature did not seem in the least troubled by it ; but , at the sound of the discharge , he had increased his speed , and now was going as fast as a horse at full gallop . “ The deuce !” ejaculated Kennedy . “ What a solid head !” commented Joe . “ We ’ ll try some conical balls behind the shoulder - joint ,” said Kennedy , reloading his rifle with care . In another moment he fired . The animal gave a terrible cry , but went on faster than ever . “ Come !” said Joe , taking aim with another gun , “ I must help you , or we ’ ll never end it .” And now two balls penetrated the creature ’ s side . The elephant halted , lifted his trunk , and resumed his run toward the wood with all his speed ; he shook his huge head , and the blood began to gush from his wounds . “ Let us keep up our fire , Mr . Kennedy .” “ And a continuous fire , too ,” urged the doctor , “ for we are close on the woods .” Ten shots more were discharged . The elephant made a fearful bound ; the car and balloon cracked as though every thing were going to pieces , and the shock made the doctor drop his hatchet on the ground . The situation was thus rendered really very alarming ; the anchor - rope , which had securely caught , could not be disengaged , nor could it yet be cut by the knives of our aeronauts , and the balloon was rushing headlong toward the wood , when the animal received a ball in the eye just as he lifted his head . On this he halted , faltered , his knees bent under him , and he uncovered his whole flank to the assaults of his enemies in the balloon . “ A bullet in his heart !” said Kennedy , discharging one last rifle - shot . The elephant uttered a long bellow of terror and agony , then raised himself up for a moment , twirling his trunk in the air , and finally fell with all his weight upon one of his tusks , which he broke off short . He was dead . “ His tusk ’ s broken !” exclaimed Kennedy --“ ivory too that in England would bring thirty - five guineas per hundred pounds .” “ As much as that ?” said Joe , scrambling down to the ground by the anchor - rope . “ What ’ s the use of sighing over it , Dick ?” said the doctor . “ Are we ivory merchants ? Did we come hither to make money ?” Joe examined the anchor and found it solidly attached to the unbroken tusk . The doctor and Dick leaped out on the ground , while the balloon , now half emptied , hovered over the body of the huge animal . “ What a splendid beast !” said Kennedy , “ what a mass of flesh ! I never saw an elephant of that size in India !” “ There ’ s nothing surprising about that , my dear Dick ; the elephants of Central Africa are the finest in the world . The Andersons and the Cummings have hunted so incessantly in the neighborhood of the Cape , that these animals have migrated to the equator , where they are often met with in large herds .” “ In the mean while , I hope ,” added Joe , “ that we ’ ll taste a morsel of this fellow . I ’ ll undertake to get you a good dinner at his expense . Mr . Kennedy will go off and hunt for an hour or two ; the doctor will make an inspection of the balloon , and , while they ’ re busy in that way , I ’ ll do the cooking .” “ A good arrangement !” said the doctor ; “ so do as you like , Joe .” “ As for me ,” said the hunter , “ I shall avail myself of the two hours ’ recess that Joe has condescended to let me have .” “ Go , my friend , but no imprudence ! Don ’ t wander too far away .” “ Never fear , doctor !” and , so saying , Dick , shouldering his gun , plunged into the woods . Forthwith Joe went to work at his vocation . At first he made a hole in the ground two feet deep ; this he filled with the dry wood that was so abundantly scattered about , where it had been strewn by the elephants , whose tracks could be seen where they had made their way through the forest . This hole filled , he heaped a pile of fagots on it a foot in height , and set fire to it . Then he went back to the carcass of the elephant , which had fallen only about a hundred feet from the edge of the forest ; he next proceeded adroitly to cut off the trunk , which might have been two feet in diameter at the base ; of this he selected the most delicate portion , and then took with it one of the animal ’ s spongy feet . In fact , these are the finest morsels , like the hump of the bison , the paws of the bear , and the head of the wild boar . When the pile of fagots had been thoroughly consumed , inside and outside , the hole , cleared of the cinders and hot coals , retained a very high temperature . The pieces of elephant - meat , surrounded with aromatic leaves , were placed in this extempore oven and covered with hot coals . Then Joe piled up a second heap of sticks over all , and when it had burned out the meat was cooked to a turn . Then Joe took the viands from the oven , spread the savory mess upon green leaves , and arranged his dinner upon a magnificent patch of greensward . He finally brought out some biscuit , some coffee , and some cognac , and got a can of pure , fresh water from a neighboring streamlet . The repast thus prepared was a pleasant sight to behold , and Joe , without being too proud , thought that it would also be pleasant to eat . “ A journey without danger or fatigue ,” he soliloquized ; “ your meals when you please ; a swinging hammock all the time ! What more could a man ask ? And there was Kennedy , who didn ’ t want to come !” On his part , Dr . Ferguson was engrossed in a serious and thorough examination of the balloon . The latter did not appear to have suffered from the storm ; the silk and the gutta percha had resisted wonderfully , and , upon estimating the exact height of the ground and the ascensional force of the balloon , our aeronaut saw , with satisfaction , that the hydrogen was in exactly the same quantity as before . The covering had remained completely waterproof . It was now only five days since our travellers had quitted Zanzibar ; their pemmican had not yet been touched ; their stock of biscuit and potted meat was enough for a long trip , and there was nothing to be replenished but the water . The pipes and spiral seemed to be in perfect condition , since , thanks to their india - rubber jointings , they had yielded to all the oscillations of the balloon . His examination ended , the doctor betook himself to setting his notes in order . He made a very accurate sketch of the surrounding landscape , with its long prairie stretching away out of sight , the forest of calmadores , and the balloon resting motionless over the body of the dead elephant . At the end of his two hours , Kennedy returned with a string of fat partridges and the haunch of an oryx , a sort of gemsbok belonging to the most agile species of antelopes . Joe took upon himself to prepare this surplus stock of provisions for a later repast . “ But , dinner ’ s ready !” he shouted in his most musical voice . And the three travellers had only to sit down on the green turf . The trunk and feet of the elephant were declared to be exquisite . Old England was toasted , as usual , and delicious Havanas perfumed this charming country for the first time . Kennedy ate , drank , and chatted , like four ; he was perfectly delighted with his new life , and seriously proposed to the doctor to settle in this forest , to construct a cabin of boughs and foliage , and , there and then , to lay the foundation of a Robinson Crusoe dynasty in Africa . The proposition went no further , although Joe had , at once , selected the part of Man Friday for himself . The country seemed so quiet , so deserted , that the doctor resolved to pass the night on the ground , and Joe arranged a circle of watch - fires as an indispensable barrier against wild animals , for the hyenas , cougars , and jackals , attracted by the smell of the dead elephant , were prowling about in the neighborhood . Kennedy had to fire his rifle several times at these unceremonious visitors , but the night passed without any untoward occurrence .
