Look !” They had just passed the borders of the forest , and the three friends could see some thirty mounted men clad in broad pantaloons and the floating bournouses . They were armed , some with lances , and others with long muskets , and they were following , on their quick , fiery little steeds , the direction of the balloon , which was moving at only moderate speed . When they caught sight of the aeronauts , they uttered savage cries , and brandished their weapons . Anger and menace could be read upon their swarthy faces , made more ferocious by thin but bristling beards . Meanwhile they galloped along without difficulty over the low levels and gentle declivities that lead down to the Senegal . “ It is , indeed , they !” said the doctor ; “ the cruel Talabas ! the ferocious marabouts of Al - Hadji ! I would rather find myself in the middle of the forest encircled by wild beasts than fall into the hands of these banditti .” “ They haven ’ t a very obliging look !” assented Kennedy ; “ and they are rough , stalwart fellows .” “ Happily those brutes can ’ t fly ,” remarked Joe ; “ and that ’ s something .” “ See ,” said Ferguson , “ those villages in ruins , those huts burned down -- that is their work ! Where vast stretches of cultivated land were once seen , they have brought barrenness and devastation .” “ At all events , however ,” interposed Kennedy , “ they can ’ t overtake us ; and , if we succeed in putting the river between us and them , we are safe .” “ Perfectly , Dick ,” replied Ferguson ; “ but we must not fall to the ground !” and , as he said this , he glanced at the barometer . “ In any case , Joe ,” added Kennedy , “ it would do us no harm to look to our fire - arms .” “ No harm in the world , Mr . Dick ! We are lucky that we didn ’ t scatter them along the road .” “ My rifle !” said the sportsman . “ I hope that I shall never be separated from it !” And so saying , Kennedy loaded the pet piece with the greatest care , for he had plenty of powder and ball remaining . “ At what height are we ?” he asked the doctor . “ About seven hundred and fifty feet ; but we no longer have the power of seeking favorable currents , either going up or coming down . We are at the mercy of the balloon !” “ That is vexatious !” rejoined Kennedy . “ The wind is poor ; but if we had come across a hurricane like some of those we met before , these vile brigands would have been out of sight long ago .” “ The rascals follow us at their leisure ,” said Joe . “ They ’ re only at a short gallop . Quite a nice little ride !” “ If we were within range ,” sighed the sportsman , “ I should amuse myself with dismounting a few of them .” “ Exactly ,” said the doctor ; “ but then they would have you within range also , and our balloon would offer only too plain a target to the bullets from their long guns ; and , if they were to make a hole in it , I leave you to judge what our situation would be !” The pursuit of the Talabas continued all morning ; and by eleven o ’ clock the aeronauts had made scarcely fifteen miles to the westward . The doctor was anxiously watching for the least cloud on the horizon . He feared , above all things , a change in the atmosphere . Should he be thrown back toward the Niger , what would become of him ? Besides , he remarked that the balloon tended to fall considerably . Since the start , he had already lost more than three hundred feet , and the Senegal must be about a dozen miles distant . At his present rate of speed , he could count upon travelling only three hours longer . At this moment his attention was attracted by fresh cries . The Talabas appeared to be much excited , and were spurring their horses . The doctor consulted his barometer , and at once discovered the cause of these symptoms . “ Are we descending ?” asked Kennedy . “ Yes !” replied the doctor . “ The mischief !” thought Joe In the lapse of fifteen minutes the Victoria was only one hundred and fifty feet above the ground ; but the wind was much stronger than before . The Talabas checked their horses , and soon a volley of musketry pealed out on the air . “ Too far , you fools !” bawled Joe . “ I think it would be well to keep those scamps at a distance .” And , as he spoke , he aimed at one of the horsemen who was farthest to the front , and fired . The Talaba fell headlong , and , his companions halting for a moment , the balloon gained upon them . “ They are prudent !” said Kennedy . “ Because they think that they are certain to take us ,” replied the doctor ; “ and , they will succeed if we descend much farther . We must , absolutely , get higher into the air .” “ What can we throw out ?” asked Joe . “ All that remains of our stock of pemmican ; that will be thirty pounds less weight to carry .” “ Out it goes , sir !” said Joe , obeying orders . The car , which was now almost touching the ground , rose again , amid the cries of the Talabas ; but , half an hour later , the balloon was again falling rapidly , because the gas was escaping through the pores of the covering . Ere long the car was once more grazing the soil , and Al - Hadji ’ s black riders rushed toward it ; but , as frequently happens in like cases , the balloon had scarcely touched the surface ere it rebounded , and only came down again a mile away . “ So we shall not escape !” said Kennedy , between his teeth . “ Throw out our reserved store of brandy , Joe ,” cried the doctor ; “ our instruments , and every thing that has any weight , even to our last anchor , because go they must !” Joe flung out the barometers and thermometers , but all that amounted to little ; and the balloon , which had risen for an instant , fell again toward the ground . The Talabas flew toward it , and at length were not more than two hundred paces away . “ Throw out the two fowling - pieces !” shouted Ferguson . “ Not without discharging them , at least ,” responded the sportsman ; and four shots in quick succession struck the thick of the advancing group of horsemen . Four Talabas fell , amid the frantic howls and imprecations of their comrades . The Victoria ascended once more , and made some enormous leaps , like a huge gum - elastic ball , bounding and rebounding through the air . A strange sight it was to see these unfortunate men endeavoring to escape by those huge aerial strides , and seeming , like the giant Antaeus , to receive fresh strength every time they touched the earth . But this situation had to terminate . It was now nearly noon ; the Victoria was getting empty and exhausted , and assuming a more and more elongated form every instant . Its outer covering was becoming flaccid , and floated loosely in the air , and the folds of the silk rustled and grated on each other . “ Heaven abandons us !” said Kennedy ; “ we have to fall !” Joe made no answer . He kept looking intently at his master . “ No !” said the latter ; “ we have more than one hundred and fifty pounds yet to throw out .” “ What can it be , then ?” said Kennedy , thinking that the doctor must be going mad . “ The car !” was his reply ; “ we can cling to the network . There we can hang on in the meshes until we reach the river . Quick ! quick !” And these daring men did not hesitate a moment to avail themselves of this last desperate means of escape . They clutched the network , as the doctor directed , and Joe , holding on by one hand , with the other cut the cords that suspended the car ; and the latter dropped to the ground just as the balloon was sinking for the last time . “ Hurrah ! hurrah !” shouted the brave fellow exultingly , as the Victoria , once more relieved , shot up again to a height of three hundred feet . The Talabas spurred their horses , which now came tearing on at a furious gallop ; but the balloon , falling in with a much more favorable wind , shot ahead of them , and was rapidly carried toward a hill that stretched across the horizon to the westward . This was a circumstance favorable to the aeronauts , because they could rise over the hill , while Al - Hadji ’ s horde had to diverge to the northward in order to pass this obstacle . The three friends still clung to the network . They had been able to fasten it under their feet , where it had formed a sort of swinging pocket . Suddenly , after they had crossed the hill , the doctor exclaimed : “ The river ! the river ! the Senegal , my friends !” And about two miles ahead of them , there was indeed the river rolling along its broad mass of water , while the farther bank , which was low and fertile , offered a sure refuge , and a place favorable for a descent . “ Another quarter of an hour ,” said Ferguson , “ and we are saved !” But it was not to happen thus ; the empty balloon descended slowly upon a tract almost entirely bare of vegetation . It was made up of long slopes and stony plains , a few bushes and some coarse grass , scorched by the sun . The Victoria touched the ground several times , and rose again , but her rebound was diminishing in height and length . At the last one , it caught by the upper part of the network in the lofty branches of a baobab , the only tree that stood there , solitary and alone , in the midst of the waste . “ It ’ s all over ,” said Kennedy . “ And at a hundred paces only from the river !” groaned Joe . The three hapless aeronauts descended to the ground , and the doctor drew his companions toward the Senegal . At this point the river sent forth a prolonged roaring ; and when Ferguson reached its bank , he recognized the falls of Gouina . But not a boat , not a living creature was to be seen . With a breadth of two thousand feet , the Senegal precipitates itself for a height of one hundred and fifty , with a thundering reverberation . It ran , where they saw it , from east to west , and the line of rocks that barred its course extended from north to south . In the midst of the falls , rocks of strange forms started up like huge ante - diluvian animals , petrified there amid the waters . The impossibility of crossing this gulf was self - evident , and Kennedy could not restrain a gesture of despair . But Dr . Ferguson , with an energetic accent of undaunted daring , exclaimed -- “ All is not over !” “ I knew it ,” said Joe , with that confidence in his master which nothing could ever shake . The sight of the dried - up grass had inspired the doctor with a bold idea . It was the last chance of escape . He led his friends quickly back to where they had left the covering of the balloon . “ We have at least an hour ’ s start of those banditti ,” said he ; “ let us lose no time , my friends ; gather a quantity of this dried grass ; I want a hundred pounds of it , at least .” “ For what purpose ?” asked Kennedy , surprised . “ I have no more gas ; well , I ’ ll cross the river with hot air !” “ Ah , doctor ,” exclaimed Kennedy , “ you are , indeed , a great man !” Joe and Kennedy at once went to work , and soon had an immense pile of dried grass heaped up near the baobab . In the mean time , the doctor had enlarged the orifice of the balloon by cutting it open at the lower end . He then was very careful to expel the last remnant of hydrogen through the valve , after which he heaped up a quantity of grass under the balloon , and set fire to it . It takes but a little while to inflate a balloon with hot air . A head of one hundred and eighty degrees is sufficient to diminish the weight of the air it contains to the extent of one - half , by rarefying it . Thus , the Victoria quickly began to assume a more rounded form . There was no lack of grass ; the fire was kept in full blast by the doctor ’ s assiduous efforts , and the balloon grew fuller every instant . It was then a quarter to four o ’ clock . At this moment the band of Talabas reappeared about two miles to the northward , and the three friends could hear their cries , and the clatter of their horses galloping at full speed . “ In twenty minutes they will be here !” said Kennedy . “ More grass ! more grass , Joe ! In ten minutes we shall have her full of hot air .” “ Here it is , doctor !” The Victoria was now two - thirds inflated . “ Come , my friends , let us take hold of the network , as we did before .” “ All right !” they answered together . In about ten minutes a few jerking motions by the balloon indicated that it was disposed to start again . The Talabas were approaching . They were hardly five hundred paces away . “ Hold on fast !” cried Ferguson . “ Have no fear , master -- have no fear !” And the doctor , with his foot pushed another heap of grass upon the fire . With this the balloon , now completely inflated by the increased temperature , moved away , sweeping the branches of the baobab in her flight . “ We ’ re off !” shouted Joe . A volley of musketry responded to his exclamation . A bullet even ploughed his shoulder ; but Kennedy , leaning over , and discharging his rifle with one hand , brought another of the enemy to the ground . Cries of fury exceeding all description hailed the departure of the balloon , which had at once ascended nearly eight hundred feet . A swift current caught and swept it along with the most alarming oscillations , while the intrepid doctor and his friends saw the gulf of the cataracts yawning below them . Ten minutes later , and without having exchanged a word , they descended gradually toward the other bank of the river . There , astonished , speechless , terrified , stood a group of men clad in the French uniform . Judge of their amazement when they saw the balloon rise from the right bank of the river . They had well - nigh taken it for some celestial phenomenon , but their officers , a lieutenant of marines and a naval ensign , having seen mention made of Dr . Ferguson ’ s daring expedition , in the European papers , quickly explained the real state of the case . The balloon , losing its inflation little by little , settled with the daring travellers still clinging to its network ; but it was doubtful whether it would reach the land . At once some of the brave Frenchmen rushed into the water and caught the three aeronauts in their arms just as the Victoria fell at the distance of a few fathoms from the left bank of the Senegal . “ Dr . Ferguson !” exclaimed the lieutenant . “ The same , sir ,” replied the doctor , quietly , “ and his two friends .” The Frenchmen escorted our travellers from the river , while the balloon , half - empty , and borne away by a swift current , sped on , to plunge , like a huge bubble , headlong with the waters of the Senegal , into the cataracts of Gouina . “ The poor Victoria !” was Joe ’ s farewell remark . The doctor could not restrain a tear , and extending his hands his two friends wrung them silently with that deep emotion which requires no spoken words .
