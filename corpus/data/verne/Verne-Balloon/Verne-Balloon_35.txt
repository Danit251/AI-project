A Throng of People on the Horizon .-- A Troop of Arabs .-- The Pursuit .-- It is He .-- Fall from Horseback .-- The Strangled Arab .-- A Ball from Kennedy .-- Adroit Manoeuvres .-- Caught up flying .-- Joe saved at last . From the moment when Kennedy resumed his post of observation in the front of the car , he had not ceased to watch the horizon with his utmost attention . After the lapse of some time he turned toward the doctor and said : “ If I am not greatly mistaken I can see , off yonder in the distance , a throng of men or animals moving . It is impossible to make them out yet , but I observe that they are in violent motion , for they are raising a great cloud of dust .” “ May it not be another contrary breeze ?” said the doctor , “ another whirlwind coming to drive us back northward again ?” and while speaking he stood up to examine the horizon . “ I think not , Samuel ; it is a troop of gazelles or of wild oxen .” “ Perhaps so , Dick ; but yon throng is some nine or ten miles from us at least , and on my part , even with the glass , I can make nothing of it !” “ At all events I shall not lose sight of it . There is something remarkable about it that excites my curiosity . Sometimes it looks like a body of cavalry manoeuvring . Ah ! I was not mistaken . It is , indeed , a squadron of horsemen . Look -- look there !” The doctor eyed the group with great attention , and , after a moment ’ s pause , remarked : “ I believe that you are right . It is a detachment of Arabs or Tibbous , and they are galloping in the same direction with us , as though in flight , but we are going faster than they , and we are rapidly gaining on them . In half an hour we shall be near enough to see them and know what they are .” Kennedy had again lifted his glass and was attentively scrutinizing them . Meanwhile the crowd of horsemen was becoming more distinctly visible , and a few were seen to detach themselves from the main body . “ It is some hunting manoeuvre , evidently ,” said Kennedy . “ Those fellows seem to be in pursuit of something . I would like to know what they are about .” “ Patience , Dick ! In a little while we shall overtake them , if they continue on the same route . We are going at the rate of twenty miles per hour , and no horse can keep up with that .” Kennedy again raised his glass , and a few minutes later he exclaimed : “ They are Arabs , galloping at the top of their speed ; I can make them out distinctly . They are about fifty in number . I can see their bournouses puffed out by the wind . It is some cavalry exercise that they are going through . Their chief is a hundred paces ahead of them and they are rushing after him at headlong speed .” “ Whoever they may be , Dick , they are not to be feared , and then , if necessary , we can go higher .” “ Wait , doctor -- wait a little !” “ It ’ s curious ,” said Kennedy again , after a brief pause , “ but there ’ s something going on that I can ’ t exactly explain . By the efforts they make , and the irregularity of their line , I should fancy that those Arabs are pursuing some one , instead of following .” “ Are you certain of that , Dick ?” “ Oh ! yes , it ’ s clear enough now . I am right ! It is a pursuit -- a hunt -- but a man - hunt ! That is not their chief riding ahead of them , but a fugitive .” “ A fugitive !” exclaimed the doctor , growing more and more interested . “ Yes !” “ Don ’ t lose sight of him , and let us wait !” Three or four miles more were quickly gained upon these horsemen , who nevertheless were dashing onward with incredible speed . “ Doctor ! doctor !” shouted Kennedy in an agitated voice . “ What is the matter , Dick ?” “ Is it an illusion ? Can it be possible ?” “ What do you mean ?” “ Wait !” and so saying , the Scot wiped the sights of his spy - glass carefully , and looked through it again intently . “ Well ?” questioned the doctor . “ It is he , doctor !” “ He !” exclaimed Ferguson with emotion . “ It is he ! no other !” and it was needless to pronounce the name . “ Yes ! it is he ! on horseback , and only a hundred paces in advance of his enemies ! He is pursued !” “ It is Joe -- Joe himself !” cried the doctor , turning pale . “ He cannot see us in his flight !” “ He will see us , though !” said the doctor , lowering the flame of his blow - pipe . “ But how ?” “ In five minutes we shall be within fifty feet of the ground , and in fifteen we shall be right over him !” “ We must let him know it by firing a gun !” “ No ! he can ’ t turn back to come this way . He ’ s headed off !” “ What shall we do , then ?” “ We must wait .” “ Wait ?-- and these Arabs !” “ We shall overtake them . We ’ ll pass them . We are not more than two miles from them , and provided that Joe ’ s horse holds out !” “ Great God !” exclaimed Kennedy , suddenly . “ What is the matter ?” Kennedy had uttered a cry of despair as he saw Joe fling himself to the ground . His horse , evidently exhausted , had just fallen headlong . “ He sees us !” cried the doctor , “ and he motions to us , as he gets upon his feet !” “ But the Arabs will overtake him ! What is he waiting for ? Ah ! the brave lad ! Huzza !” shouted the sportsman , who could no longer restrain his feelings . Joe , who had immediately sprung up after his fall , just as one of the swiftest horsemen rushed upon him , bounded like a panther , avoided his assailant by leaping to one side , jumped up behind him on the crupper , seized the Arab by the throat , and , strangling him with his sinewy hands and fingers of steel , flung him on the sand , and continued his headlong flight . A tremendous howl was heard from the Arabs , but , completely engrossed by the pursuit , they had not taken notice of the balloon , which was now but five hundred paces behind them , and only about thirty feet from the ground . On their part , they were not twenty lengths of their horses from the fugitive . One of them was very perceptibly gaining on Joe , and was about to pierce him with his lance , when Kennedy , with fixed eye and steady hand , stopped him short with a ball , that hurled him to the earth . Joe did not even turn his head at the report . Some of the horsemen reined in their barbs , and fell on their faces in the dust as they caught sight of the Victoria ; the rest continued their pursuit . “ But what is Joe about ?” said Kennedy ; “ he don ’ t stop !” “ He ’ s doing better than that , Dick ! I understand him ! He ’ s keeping on in the same direction as the balloon . He relies upon our intelligence . Ah ! the noble fellow ! We ’ ll carry him off in the very teeth of those Arab rascals ! We are not more than two hundred paces from him !” “ What are we to do ?” asked Kennedy . “ Lay aside your rifle , Dick .” And the Scot obeyed the request at once . “ Do you think that you can hold one hundred and fifty pounds of ballast in your arms ?” “ Ay , more than that !” “ No ! That will be enough !” And the doctor proceeded to pile up bags of sand in Kennedy ’ s arms . “ Hold yourself in readiness in the back part of the car , and be prepared to throw out that ballast at a single effort . But , for your life , don ’ t do so until I give the word !” “ Be easy on that point .” “ Otherwise , we should miss Joe , and he would be lost .” “ Count upon me !” The Victoria at that moment almost commanded the troop of horsemen who were still desperately urging their steeds at Joe ’ s heels . The doctor , standing in the front of the car , held the ladder clear , ready to throw it at any moment . Meanwhile , Joe had still maintained the distance between himself and his pursuers -- say about fifty feet . The Victoria was now ahead of the party . “ Attention !” exclaimed the doctor to Kennedy . “ I ’ m ready !” “ Joe , look out for yourself !” shouted the doctor in his sonorous , ringing voice , as he flung out the ladder , the lowest ratlines of which tossed up the dust of the road . As the doctor shouted , Joe had turned his head , but without checking his horse . The ladder dropped close to him , and at the instant he grasped it the doctor again shouted to Kennedy : “ Throw ballast !” “ It ’ s done !” And the Victoria , lightened by a weight greater than Joe ’ s , shot up one hundred and fifty feet into the air . Joe clung with all his strength to the ladder during the wide oscillations that it had to describe , and then making an indescribable gesture to the Arabs , and climbing with the agility of a monkey , he sprang up to his companions , who received him with open arms . The Arabs uttered a scream of astonishment and rage . The fugitive had been snatched from them on the wing , and the Victoria was rapidly speeding far beyond their reach . “ Master ! Kennedy !” ejaculated Joe , and overwhelmed , at last , with fatigue and emotion , the poor fellow fainted away , while Kennedy , almost beside himself , kept exclaiming : “ Saved -- saved !” “ Saved indeed !” murmured the doctor , who had recovered all his phlegmatic coolness . Joe was almost naked . His bleeding arms , his body covered with cuts and bruises , told what his sufferings had been . The doctor quietly dressed his wounds , and laid him comfortably under the awning . Joe soon returned to consciousness , and asked for a glass of brandy , which the doctor did not see fit to refuse , as the faithful fellow had to be indulged . After he had swallowed the stimulant , Joe grasped the hands of his two friends and announced that he was ready to relate what had happened to him . But they would not allow him to talk at that time , and he sank back into a profound sleep , of which he seemed to have the greatest possible need . The Victoria was then taking an oblique line to the westward . Driven by a tempestuous wind , it again approached the borders of the thorny desert , which the travellers descried over the tops of palm - trees , bent and broken by the storm ; and , after having made a run of two hundred miles since rescuing Joe , it passed the tenth degree of east longitude about nightfall .
