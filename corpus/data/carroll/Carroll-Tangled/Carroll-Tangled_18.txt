_Problem . _ -- Given that one glass of lemonade , 3 sandwiches , and 7 biscuits , cost 1_s . _ 2_d . _ ; and that one glass of lemonade , 4 sandwiches , and 10 biscuits , cost 1_s . _ 5_d . _ : find the cost of ( 1 ) a glass of lemonade , a sandwich , and a biscuit ; and ( 2 ) 2 glasses of lemonade , 3 sandwiches , and 5 biscuits . _Answer . _ --( 1 ) 8_d . _ ; ( 2 ) 1_s . _ 7_d . _ _Solution . _ -- This is best treated algebraically . Let _x_ = the cost ( in pence ) of a glass of lemonade , _y_ of a sandwich , and _z_ of a biscuit . Then we have _x_ + 3_y_ + 7_z_ = 14 , and _x_ + 4_y_ + 10_z_ = 17 . And we require the values of _x_ + _y_ + _z_ , and of 2_x_ + 3_y_ + 5_z_ . Now , from _two_ equations only , we cannot find , _separately_ , the values of _three_ unknowns : certain _combinations_ of them may , however , be found . Also we know that we can , by the help of the given equations , eliminate 2 of the 3 unknowns from the quantity whose value is required , which will then contain one only . If , then , the required value is ascertainable at all , it can only be by the 3rd unknown vanishing of itself : otherwise the problem is impossible . Let us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches , and reduce everything to biscuits -- a state of things even more depressing than " if all the world were apple - pie "-- by subtracting the 1st equation from the 2nd , which eliminates lemonade , and gives _y_ + 3_z_ = 3 , or _y_ = 3 - 3_z_ ; and then substituting this value of _y_ in the 1st , which gives _x_ - 2_z_ = 5 , _i . e . _ _x_ = 5 + 2_z_ . Now if we substitute these values of _x_ , _y_ , in the quantities whose values are required , the first becomes ( 5 + 2_z_ ) + ( 3 - 3_z_ ) + _z_ , _i . e . _ 8 : and the second becomes 2 ( 5 + 2_z_ ) + 3 ( 3 - 3_z_ ) + 5_z_ , _i . e . _ 19 . Hence the answers are ( 1 ) 8_d . _ , ( 2 ) 1_s . _ 7_d . _ * * * * * The above is a _universal_ method : that is , it is absolutely certain either to produce the answer , or to prove that no answer is possible . The question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values are given , so as to form those whose values are required . This is merely a matter of ingenuity and good luck : and as it _may_ fail , even when the thing is possible , and is of no use in proving it _im_possible , I cannot rank this method as equal in value with the other . Even when it succeeds , it may prove a very tedious process . Suppose the 26 competitors , who have sent in what I may call _accidental_ solutions , had had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10 digits ! I suspect it would have been a case of " silvered is the raven hair " ( see " Patience ") before any solution would have been hit on by the most ingenious of them . Forty - five answers have come in , of which 44 give , I am happy to say , some sort of _working_ , and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name , and to have their virtues , or vices as the case may be , discussed . Thirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right , and so cannot figure in the Class - list , even though , in 10 of the 13 cases , the answer is right . Of the remaining 28 , no less than 26 have sent in _accidental_ solutions , and therefore fall short of the highest honours . I will now discuss individual cases , taking the worst first , as my custom is . FROGGY gives no working -- at least this is all he gives : after stating the given equations , he says " therefore the difference , 1 sandwich + 3 biscuits , = 3_d . _ ": then follow the amounts of the unknown bills , with no further hint as to how he got them . FROGGY has had a _very_ narrow escape of not being named at all ! Of those who are wrong , VIS INERTIÆ has sent in a piece of incorrect working . Peruse the horrid details , and shudder ! She takes _x_ ( call it " _y_ ") as the cost of a sandwich , and concludes ( rightly enough ) that a biscuit will cost ( 3 - _y_ )/ 3 . She then subtracts the second equation from the first , and deduces 3_y_ + 7 × ( 3 - _y_ )/ 3 - 4_y_ + 10 × ( 3 - _y_ )/ 3 = 3 . By making two mistakes in this line , she brings out _y_ = 3 / 2 . Try it again , oh VIS INERTIÆ ! Away with INERTIÆ : infuse a little more VIS : and you will bring out the correct ( though uninteresting ) result , 0 = 0 ! This will show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 3 unknowns to reveal its _separate_ value . The other competitor , who is wrong throughout , is either J . M . C . or T . M . C .: but , whether he be a Juvenile Mis - Calculator or a True Mathematician Confused , he makes the answers 7_d . _ and 1_s . _ 5_d . _ He assumes , with Too Much Confidence , that biscuits were 1 / 2_d . _ each , and that Clara paid for 8 , though she only ate 7 ! We will now consider the 13 whose working is wrong , though the answer is right : and , not to measure their demerits too exactly , I will take them in alphabetical order . ANITA finds ( rightly ) that " 1 sandwich and 3 biscuits cost 3_d . _ ," and proceeds " therefore 1 sandwich = 1 - 1 / 2_d . _ , 3 biscuits = 1 - 1 / 2_d . _ , 1 lemonade = 6_d . _ " DINAH MITE begins like ANITA : and thence proves ( rightly ) that a biscuit costs less than a 1_d . _ : whence she concludes ( wrongly ) that it _must_ cost 1 / 2_d . _ F . C . W . is so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of " guilty ," that I have hardly the heart to utter the word , without adding a " recommended to mercy owing to extenuating circumstances ." But really , you know , where _are_ the extenuating circumstances ? She begins by assuming that lemonade is 4_d . _ a glass , and sandwiches 3_d . _ each , ( making with the 2 given equations , _four_ conditions to be fulfilled by _three_ miserable unknowns !). And , having ( naturally ) developed this into a contradiction , she then tries 5_d . _ and 2_d . _ with a similar result . ( N . B . _This_ process might have been carried on through the whole of the Tertiary Period , without gratifying one single Megatherium .) She then , by a " happy thought ," tries half - penny biscuits , and so obtains a consistent result . This may be a good solution , viewing the problem as a conundrum : but it is _not_ scientific . JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits ! " One sandwich + 3 biscuits " she makes equal to " 4 ." Four _what_ ? MAYFAIR makes the astounding assertion that the equation , _s_ + 3_b_ = 3 , " is evidently only satisfied by _s_ = 3 / 2 , _b_ = 1 / 2 "! OLD CAT believes that the assumption that a sandwich costs 1 - 1 / 2_d . _ is " the only way to avoid unmanageable fractions ." But _why_ avoid them ? Is there not a certain glow of triumph in taming such a fraction ? " Ladies and gentlemen , the fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a refining nature : it was , in a word , hopelessly vulgar . Treating it as a circulating decimal ( the treadmill of fractions ) only made matters worse . As a last resource , I reduced it to its lowest terms , and extracted its square root !" Joking apart , let me thank OLD CAT for some very kind words of sympathy , in reference to a correspondent ( whose name I am happy to say I have now forgotten ) who had found fault with me as a discourteous critic . O . V . L . is beyond my comprehension . He takes the given equations as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ): thence , by the process [( 2 )-( 1 )] deduces ( rightly ) equation ( 3 ) viz . _s_ + 3_b_ = 3 : and thence again , by the process [ x3 ] ( a hopeless mystery ), deduces 3_s_ + 4_b_ = 4 . I have nothing to say about it : I give it up . SEA - BREEZE says " it is immaterial to the answer " ( why ?) " in what proportion 3_d . _ is divided between the sandwich and the 3 biscuits ": so she assumes _s_ = l - 1 / 2_d . _ , _b_ = 1 / 2_d . _ STANZA is one of a very irregular metre . At first she ( like JANET ) identifies sandwiches with biscuits . She then tries two assumptions ( _s_ = 1 , _b_ = 2 / 3 , and _s_ = 1 / 2 _b_ = 5 / 6 ), and ( naturally ) ends in contradictions . Then she returns to the first assumption , and finds the 3 unknowns separately : _quod est absurdum_ . STILETTO identifies sandwiches and biscuits , as " articles ." Is the word ever used by confectioners ? I fancied " What is the next article , Ma ' am ?" was limited to linendrapers . TWO SISTERS first assume that biscuits are 4 a penny , and then that they are 2 a penny , adding that " the answer will of course be the same in both cases ." It is a dreamy remark , making one feel something like Macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger . " Is this a statement that I see before me ?" If you were to say " we both walked the same way this morning ," and _I_ were to say " _one_ of you walked the same way , but the other didn ' t ," which of the three would be the most hopelessly confused ? TURTLE PYATE ( what _is_ a Turtle Pyate , please ?) and OLD CROW , who send a joint answer , and Y . Y ., adopt the same method . Y . Y . gets the equation _s_ + 3_b_ = 3 : and then says " this sum must be apportioned in one of the three following ways ." It _may_ be , I grant you : but Y . Y . do you say " must "? I fear it is _possible_ for Y . Y . to be _two_ Y ' s . The other two conspirators are less positive : they say it " can " be so divided : but they add " either of the three prices being right "! This is bad grammar and bad arithmetic at once , oh mysterious birds ! Of those who win honours , THE SHETLAND SNARK must have the 3rd class all to himself . He has only answered half the question , viz . the amount of Clara ' s luncheon : the two little old ladies he pitilessly leaves in the midst of their " difficulty ." I beg to assure him ( with thanks for his friendly remarks ) that entrance - fees and subscriptions are things unknown in that most economical of clubs , " The Knot - Untiers ." The authors of the 26 " accidental " solutions differ only in the number of steps they have taken between the _data_ and the answers . In order to do them full justice I have arranged the 2nd class in sections , according to the number of steps . The two Kings are fearfully deliberate ! I suppose walking quick , or taking short cuts , is inconsistent with kingly dignity : but really , in reading THESEUS ' solution , one almost fancied he was " marking time ," and making no advance at all ! The other King will , I hope , pardon me for having altered " Coal " into " Cole ." King Coilus , or Coil , seems to have reigned soon after Arthur ' s time . Henry of Huntingdon identifies him with the King Coël who first built walls round Colchester , which was named after him . In the Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester we read :-- " Aftur Kyng Aruirag , of wam we habbeth y told , Marius ys sone was kyng , quoynte mon & bold . And ys sone was aftur hym , _Coil_ was ys name , Bothe it were quoynte men , & of noble fame ." BALBUS lays it down as a general principle that " in order to ascertain the cost of any one luncheon , it must come to the same amount upon two different assumptions ." ( _Query . _ Should not " it " be " we "? Otherwise the _luncheon_ is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost !) He then makes two assumptions -- one , that sandwiches cost nothing ; the other , that biscuits cost nothing , ( either arrangement would lead to the shop being inconveniently crowded !) -- and brings out the unknown luncheons as 8_d . _ and 19_d . _ , on each assumption . He then concludes that this agreement of results " shows that the answers are correct ." Now I propose to disprove his general law by simply giving _one_ instance of its failing . One instance is quite enough . In logical language , in order to disprove a " universal affirmative ," it is enough to prove its contradictory , which is a " particular negative ." ( I must pause for a digression on Logic , and especially on Ladies ' Logic . The universal affirmative " everybody says he ' s a duck " is crushed instantly by proving the particular negative " Peter says he ' s a goose ," which is equivalent to " Peter does _not_ say he ' s a duck ." And the universal negative " nobody calls on her " is well met by the particular affirmative " _I_ called yesterday ." In short , either of two contradictories disproves the other : and the moral is that , since a particular proposition is much more easily proved than a universal one , it is the wisest course , in arguing with a Lady , to limit one ' s _own_ assertions to " particulars ," and leave _her_ to prove the " universal " contradictory , if she can . You will thus generally secure a _logical_ victory : a _practical_ victory is not to be hoped for , since she can always fall back upon the crushing remark " _that_ has nothing to do with it !" -- a move for which Man has not yet discovered any satisfactory answer . Now let us return to BALBUS .) Here is my " particular negative ," on which to test his rule . Suppose the two recorded luncheons to have been " 2 buns , one queen - cake , 2 sausage - rolls , and a bottle of Zoëdone : total , one - and - ninepence ," and " one bun , 2 queen - cakes , a sausage - roll , and a bottle of Zoëdone : total , one - and - fourpence ." And suppose Clara ' s unknown luncheon to have been " 3 buns , one queen - cake , one sausage - roll , and 2 bottles of Zoëdone :" while the two little sisters had been indulging in " 8 buns , 4 queen - cakes , 2 sausage - rolls , and 6 bottles of Zoëdone ." ( Poor souls , how thirsty they must have been !) If BALBUS will kindly try this by his principle of " two assumptions ," first assuming that a bun is 1_d . _ and a queen - cake 2_d . _ , and then that a bun is 3_d . _ and a queen - cake 3_d . _ , he will bring out the other two luncheons , on each assumption , as " one - and - nine - pence " and " four - and - ten - pence " respectively , which harmony of results , he will say , " shows that the answers are correct ." And yet , as a matter of fact , the buns were 2_d . _ each , the queen - cakes 3_d . _ , the sausage - rolls 6_d . _ , and the Zoëdone 2_d . _ a bottle : so that Clara ' s third luncheon had cost one - and - sevenpence , and her thirsty friends had spent four - and - fourpence ! Another remark of BALBUS I will quote and discuss : for I think that it also may yield a moral for some of my readers . He says " it is the same thing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call it Arithmetic , or use letters and signs and call it Algebra ." Now this does not appear to me a correct description of the two methods : the Arithmetical method is that of " synthesis " only ; it goes from one known fact to another , till it reaches its goal : whereas the Algebraical method is that of " analysis ": it begins with the goal , symbolically represented , and so goes backwards , dragging its veiled victim with it , till it has reached the full daylight of known facts , in which it can tear off the veil and say " I know you !" Take an illustration . Your house has been broken into and robbed , and you appeal to the policeman who was on duty that night . " Well , Mum , I did see a chap getting out over your garden - wall : but I was a good bit off , so I didn ' t chase him , like . I just cut down the short way to the Chequers , and who should I meet but Bill Sykes , coming full split round the corner . So I just ups and says ' My lad , you ' re wanted .' That ' s all I says . And he says ' I ' ll go along quiet , Bobby ,' he says , ' without the darbies ,' he says ." There ' s your _Arithmetical_ policeman . Now try the other method . " I seed somebody a running , but he was well gone or ever _I_ got nigh the place . So I just took a look round in the garden . And I noticed the foot - marks , where the chap had come right across your flower - beds . They was good big foot - marks sure - ly . And I noticed as the left foot went down at the heel , ever so much deeper than the other . And I says to myself ' The chap ' s been a big hulking chap : and he goes lame on his left foot .' And I rubs my hand on the wall where he got over , and there was soot on it , and no mistake . So I says to myself ' Now where can I light on a big man , in the chimbley - sweep line , what ' s lame of one foot ?' And I flashes up permiscuous : and I says ' It ' s Bill Sykes !' says I ." There is your _Algebraical_ policeman -- a higher intellectual type , to my thinking , than the other . LITTLE JACK ' S solution calls for a word of praise , as he has written out what really is an algebraical proof _in words_ , without representing any of his facts as equations . If it is all his own , he will make a good algebraist in the time to come . I beg to thank SIMPLE SUSAN for some kind words of sympathy , to the same effect as those received from OLD CAT . HECLA and MARTREB are the only two who have used a method _certain_ either to produce the answer , or else to prove it impossible : so they must share between them the highest honours . CLASS LIST .

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS . I have received several letters on the subjects of Knots II . and VI ., which lead me to think some further explanation desirable . In Knot II ., I had intended the numbering of the houses to begin at one corner of the Square , and this was assumed by most , if not all , of the competitors . TROJANUS however says " assuming , in default of any information , that the street enters the square in the middle of each side , it may be supposed that the numbering begins at a street ." But surely the other is the more natural assumption ? In Knot VI ., the first Problem was of course a mere _jeu de mots_ , whose presence I thought excusable in a series of Problems whose aim is to entertain rather than to instruct : but it has not escaped the contemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents , who seem to think that Apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch . Neither of them has guessed it : and this is true human nature . Only the other day -- the 31st of September , to be quite exact -- I met my old friend Brown , and gave him a riddle I had just heard . With one great effort of his colossal mind , Brown guessed it . " Right !" said I . " Ah ," said he , " it ' s very neat -- very neat . And it isn ' t an answer that would occur to everybody . Very neat indeed ." A few yards further on , I fell in with Smith and to him I propounded the same riddle . He frowned over it for a minute , and then gave it up . Meekly I faltered out the answer . " A poor thing , sir !" Smith growled , as he turned away . " A very poor thing ! I wonder you care to repeat such rubbish !" Yet Smith ' s mind is , if possible , even more colossal than Brown ' s . The second Problem of Knot VI . is an example in ordinary Double Rule of Three , whose essential feature is that the result depends on the variation of several elements , which are so related to it that , if all but one be constant , it varies as that one : hence , if none be constant , it varies as their product . Thus , for example , the cubical contents of a rectangular tank vary as its length , if breadth and depth be constant , and so on ; hence , if none be constant , it varies as the product of the length , breadth , and depth . When the result is not thus connected with the varying elements , the Problem ceases to be Double Rule of Three and often becomes one of great complexity . To illustrate this , let us take two candidates for a prize , _A_ and _B_ , who are to compete in French , German , and Italian : ( _a_ ) Let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their _relative_ knowledge of each subject , so that , whether their marks , for French , be " 1 , 2 " or " 100 , 200 ," the result will be the same : and let it also be laid down that , if they get equal marks on 2 papers , the final marks are to have the same ratio as those of the 3rd paper . This is a case of ordinary Double Rule of Three . We multiply _A_ ' s 3 marks together , and do the same for _B_ . Note that , if _A_ gets a single " 0 ," his final mark is " 0 ," even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while _B_ gets only one mark for each paper . This of course would be very unfair on _A_ , though a correct solution under the given conditions . ( _b_ ) The result is to depend , as before , on _relative_ knowledge ; but French is to have twice as much weight as German or Italian . This is an unusual form of question . I should be inclined to say " the resulting ratio is to be nearer to the French ratio than if we multiplied as in ( _a_ ), and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other multipliers _twice_ to produce the same result as in ( _a_ ):" _e . g . _ if the French Ratio were 9 / 10 , and the others 4 / 9 , 1 / 9 so that the ultimate ratio , by method ( _a_ ), would be 2 / 45 , I should multiply instead by 2 / 3 , 1 / 3 , giving the result , 1 / 3 which is nearer to 9 / 10 than if he had used method ( _a_ ). ( _c_ ) The result is to depend on _actual_ amount of knowledge of the 3 subjects collectively . Here we have to ask two questions . ( 1 ) What is to be the " unit " ( _i . e . _ " standard to measure by ") in each subject ? ( 2 ) Are these units to be of equal , or unequal value ? The usual " unit " is the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly ; calling this " 100 ," all lower amounts are represented by numbers between " 0 " and " 100 ." Then , if these units are to be of equal value , we simply add _A_ ' s 3 marks together , and do the same for _B_ . ( _d_ ) The conditions are the same as ( _c_ ), but French is to have double weight . Here we simply double the French marks , and add as before . ( _e_ ) French is to have such weight , that , if other marks be equal , the ultimate ratio is to be that of the French paper , so that a " 0 " in this would swamp the candidate : but the other two subjects are only to affect the result collectively , by the amount of knowledge shown , the two being reckoned of equal value . Here I should add _A_ ' s German and Italian marks together , and multiply by his French mark . But I need not go on : the problem may evidently be set with many varying conditions , each requiring its own method of solution . The Problem in Knot VI . was meant to belong to variety ( _a_ ), and to make this clear , I inserted the following passage : " Usually the competitors differ in one point only . Thus , last year , Fifi and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial week , and they were equally light ; but Fifi ' s were twice as warm as Gogo ' s , and she was pronounced twice as good ." What I have said will suffice , I hope , as an answer to BALBUS , who holds that ( _a_ ) and ( _c_ ) are the only possible varieties of the problem , and that to say " We cannot use addition , therefore we must be intended to use multiplication ," is " no more illogical than , from knowledge that one was not born in the night , to infer that he was born in the daytime "; and also to FIFEE , who says " I think a little more consideration will show you that our ' error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together for each candidate instead of _multiplying_ ' is no error at all ." Why , even if addition _had_ been the right method to use , not one of the writers ( I speak from memory ) showed any consciousness of the necessity of fixing a " unit " for each subject . " No error at all !" They were positively steeped in error ! One correspondent ( I do not name him , as the communication is not quite friendly in tone ) writes thus :--" I wish to add , very respectfully , that I think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very trenchant expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when criticising the answer . That such a tone must not be " (" be not "?) " agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly have no great weight with you , but I hope you will feel that it would be as well not to employ it , _unless you are quite certain of being correct yourself_ ." The only instances the writer gives of the " trenchant expressions " are " hapless " and " malefactors ." I beg to assure him ( and any others who may need the assurance : I trust there are none ) that all such words have been used in jest , and with no idea that they could possibly annoy any one , and that I sincerely regret any annoyance I may have thus inadvertently given . May I hope that in future they will recognise the distinction between severe language used in sober earnest , and the " words of unmeant bitterness ," which Coleridge has alluded to in that lovely passage beginning " A little child , a limber elf "? If the writer will refer to that passage , or to the preface to " Fire , Famine , and Slaughter ," he will find the distinction , for which I plead , far better drawn out than I could hope to do in any words of mine . The writer ' s insinuation that I care not how much annoyance I give to my readers I think it best to pass over in silence ; but to his concluding remark I must entirely demur . I hold that to use language likely to annoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by the plea that I was " quite certain of being correct ." I trust that the knot - untiers and I are not on such terms as those ! I beg to thank _G . B . _ for the offer of a puzzle -- which , however , is too like the old one " Make four 9 ' s into 100 ."
