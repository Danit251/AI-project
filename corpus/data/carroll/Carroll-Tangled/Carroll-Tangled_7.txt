DE OMNIBUS REBUS . " This little pig went to market : This little pig staid at home ." " By Her Radiancy ' s express command ," said the Governor , as he conducted the travellers , for the last time , from the Imperial presence , " I shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the Military Quarter , where the agony of parting -- if indeed Nature can survive the shock -- must be endured ! From that gate grurmstipths start every quarter of an hour , both ways ----" " Would you mind repeating that word ?" said Norman . " Grurm ----?" " Grurmstipths ," the Governor repeated . " You call them omnibuses in England . They run both ways , and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour ." The old man breathed a sigh of relief ; four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him , and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos . In another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle , paved with marble , and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner . Soldiers , carrying pigs , were marching in all directions : and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder , which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs . " It is the Commander - in - Chief !" the Governor hurriedly whispered to his companions , who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves before the great man . The Commander gravely bowed in return . He was covered with gold lace from head to foot : his face wore an expression of deep misery : and he had a little black pig under each arm . Still the gallant fellow did his best , in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men , to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests . " Farewell , oh old one -- carry these three to the South corner -- and farewell to thee , thou young one -- put this fat one on the top of the others in the Western sty -- may your shadows never be less -- woe is me , it is wrongly done ! Empty out all the sties , and begin again !" And the soldier leant upon his sword , and wiped away a tear . " He is in distress ," the Governor explained as they left the court . " Her Radiancy has commanded him to place twenty - four pigs in those four sties , so that , as she goes round the court , she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last ." " Does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is ?" said Norman . " Surely ," said the Governor . " Her Radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine is -- and also nearer than eleven is ." " Then I think it can be done ," said Norman . The Governor shook his head . " The Commander has been transferring them in vain for four months ," he said . " What hope remains ? And Her Radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional ----" " The pigs don ' t seem to enjoy being transferred ," the old man hastily interrupted . He did not like the subject of bamboos . " They are only _provisionally_ transferred , you know ," said the Governor . " In most cases they are immediately carried back again : so they need not mind it . And all is done with the greatest care , under the personal superintendence of the Commander - in - Chief ." " Of course she would only go _once_ round ?" said Norman . " Alas , no !" sighed their conductor . " Round and round . Round and round . These are Her Radiancy ' s own words . But oh , agony ! Here is the outer gate , and we must part !" He sobbed as he shook hands with them , and the next moment was briskly walking away . " He _might_ have waited to see us off !" said the old man , piteously . " And he needn ' t have begun whistling the very _moment_ he left us !" said the young one , severely . " But look sharp -- here are two what ' s - his - names in the act of starting !" Unluckily , the sea - bound omnibus was full . " Never mind !" said Norman , cheerily . " We ' ll walk on till the next one overtakes us ." They trudged on in silence , both thinking over the military problem , till they met an omnibus coming from the sea . The elder traveller took out his watch . " Just twelve minutes and a half since we started ," he remarked in an absent manner . Suddenly the vacant face brightened ; the old man had an idea . " My boy !" he shouted , bringing his hand down upon Norman ' s shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support . Thus taken off his guard , the young man wildly staggered forwards , and seemed about to plunge into space : but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself . " Problem in Precession and Nutation ," he remarked -- in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance . " What is it ?" he hastily added , fearing his father might have been taken ill . " Will you have some brandy ?" " When will the next omnibus overtake us ? When ? When ?" the old man cried , growing more excited every moment . Norman looked gloomy . " Give me time ," he said . " I must think it over ." And once more the travellers passed on in silence -- a silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs , who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty , under the personal superintendence of the Commander - in - Chief .
