ยง 1 . THE CHELSEA PENSIONERS . _Problem . _ -- If 70 per cent . have lost an eye , 75 per cent . an ear , 80 per cent . an arm , 85 per cent . a leg : what percentage , _at least_ , must have lost all four ? _Answer . _ -- Ten . _Solution . _ --( I adopt that of POLAR STAR , as being better than my own ). Adding the wounds together , we get 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 = 310 , among 100 men ; which gives 3 to each , and 4 to 10 men . Therefore the least percentage is 10 . * * * * * Nineteen answers have been received . One is " 5 ," but , as no working is given with it , it must , in accordance with the rule , remain " a deed without a name ." JANET makes it " 35 and 7 / 10ths ." I am sorry she has misunderstood the question , and has supposed that those who had lost an ear were 75 per cent . _of those who had lost an eye_ ; and so on . Of course , on this supposition , the percentages must all be multiplied together . This she has done correctly , but I can give her no honours , as I do not think the question will fairly bear her interpretation , THREE SCORE AND TEN makes it " 19 and 3 / 8ths ." Her solution has given me -- I will not say " many anxious days and sleepless nights ," for I wish to be strictly truthful , but -- some trouble in making any sense at all of it . She makes the number of " pensioners wounded once " to be 310 (" per cent .," I suppose ! ): dividing by 4 , she gets 77 and a half as " average percentage :" again dividing by 4 , she gets 19 and 3 / 8ths as " percentage wounded four times ." Does she suppose wounds of different kinds to " absorb " each other , so to speak ? Then , no doubt , the _data_ are equivalent to 77 pensioners with one wound each , and a half - pensioner with a half - wound . And does she then suppose these concentrated wounds to be _transferable_ , so that 3 / 4ths of these unfortunates can obtain perfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining 1 / 4th ? Granting these suppositions , her answer is right ; or rather , _if_ the question had been " A road is covered with one inch of gravel , along 77 and a half per cent . of it . How much of it could be covered 4 inches deep with the same material ?" her answer _would_ have been right . But alas , that _wasn ' t_ the question ! DELTA makes some most amazing assumptions : " let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear ," " let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm ." Her ideas of a battle - field are grim indeed . Fancy a warrior who would continue fighting after losing both eyes , both ears , and both arms ! This is a case which she ( or " it ?") evidently considers _possible_ . Next come eight writers who have made the unwarrantable assumption that , because 70 per cent . have lost an eye , _therefore_ 30 per cent . have _not_ lost one , so that they have _both_ eyes . This is illogical . If you give me a bag containing 100 sovereigns , and if in an hour I come to you ( my face _not_ beaming with gratitude nearly so much as when I received the bag ) to say " I am sorry to tell you that 70 of these sovereigns are bad ," do I thereby guarantee the other 30 to be good ? Perhaps I have not tested them yet . The sides of this illogical octagon are as follows , in alphabetical order :-- ALGERNON BRAY , DINAH MITE , G . S . C ., JANE E ., J . D . W ., MAGPIE ( who makes the delightful remark " therefore 90 per cent . have two of something ," recalling to one ' s memory that fortunate monarch , with whom Xerxes was so much pleased that " he gave him ten of everything ! "), S . S . G ., and TOKIO . BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE and T . R . do the question in a piecemeal fashion -- on the principle that the 70 per cent . and the 75 per cent ., though commenced at opposite ends of the 100 , must overlap by _at least_ 45 per cent . ; and so on . This is quite correct working , but not , I think , quite the best way of doing it . The other five competitors will , I hope , feel themselves sufficiently glorified by being placed in the first class , without my composing a Triumphal Ode for each ! CLASS LIST . I . OLD CAT .

CHANGE OF DAY . I must postpone , _sine die_ , the geographical problem -- partly because I have not yet received the statistics I am hoping for , and partly because I am myself so entirely puzzled by it ; and when an examiner is himself dimly hovering between a second class and a third how is he to decide the position of others ? ยง 3 . THE SONS ' AGES . _Problem . _ --" At first , two of the ages are together equal to the third . A few years afterwards , two of them are together double of the third . When the number of years since the first occasion is two - thirds of the sum of the ages on that occasion , one age is 21 . What are the other two ? _Answer . _ --" 15 and 18 ." * * * * * _Solution . _ -- Let the ages at first be _x_ , _y_ , ( _x_ + _y_ ). Now , if _a_ + _b_ = 2_c_ , then ( _a_ - _n_ ) + ( _b_ - _n_ ) = 2 ( _c_ - _n_ ), whatever be the value of _n_ . Hence the second relationship , if _ever_ true , was _always_ true . Hence it was true at first . But it cannot be true that _x_ and _y_ are together double of ( _x_ + _y_ ). Hence it must be true of ( _x_ + _y_ ), together with _x_ or _y_ ; and it does not matter which we take . We assume , then , ( _x_ + _y_ ) + _x_ = 2_y_ ; _i . e . _ _y_ = 2_x_ . Hence the three ages were , at first , _x_ , 2_x_ , 3_x_ ; and the number of years , since that time is two - thirds of 6_x_ , _i . e . _ is 4_x_ . Hence the present ages are 5_x_ , 6_x_ , 7_x_ . The ages are clearly _integers_ , since this is only " the year when one of my sons comes of age ." Hence 7_x_ = 21 , _x_ = 3 , and the other ages are 15 , 18 . * * * * * Eighteen answers have been received . One of the writers merely asserts that the first occasion was 12 years ago , that the ages were then 9 , 6 , and 3 ; and that on the second occasion they were 14 , 11 , and 8 ! As a Roman father , I _ought_ to withhold the name of the rash writer ; but respect for age makes me break the rule : it is THREE SCORE AND TEN . JANE E . also asserts that the ages at first were 9 , 6 , 3 : then she calculates the present ages , leaving the _second_ occasion unnoticed . OLD HEN is nearly as bad ; she " tried various numbers till I found one that fitted _all_ the conditions "; but merely scratching up the earth , and pecking about , is _not_ the way to solve a problem , oh venerable bird ! And close after OLD HEN prowls , with hungry eyes , OLD CAT , who calmly assumes , to begin with , that the son who comes of age is the _eldest_ . Eat your bird , Puss , for you will get nothing from me ! There are yet two zeroes to dispose of . MINERVA assumes that , on _every_ occasion , a son comes of age ; and that it is only such a son who is " tipped with gold ." Is it wise thus to interpret " now , my boys , calculate your ages , and you shall have the money "? BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE says " let " the ages at first be 9 , 6 , 3 , then assumes that the second occasion was 6 years afterwards , and on these baseless assumptions brings out the right answers . Guide _future_ travellers , an thou wilt : thou art no Bradshaw for _this_ Age ! Of those who win honours , the merely " honourable " are two . DINAH MITE ascertains ( rightly ) the relationship between the three ages at first , but then _assumes_ one of them to be " 6 ," thus making the rest of her solution tentative . M . F . C . does the algebra all right up to the conclusion that the present ages are 5_z_ , 6_z_ , and 7_z_ ; it then assumes , without giving any reason , that 7_z_ = 21 . Of the more honourable , DELTA attempts a novelty -- to discover _which_ son comes of age by elimination : it assumes , successively , that it is the middle one , and that it is the youngest ; and in each case it _apparently_ brings out an absurdity . Still , as the proof contains the following bit of algebra , " 63 = 7_x_ + 4_y_ ; [** therefore ] 21 = _x_ + 4 sevenths of _y_ ," I trust it will admit that its proof is not _quite_ conclusive . The rest of its work is good . MAGPIE betrays the deplorable tendency of her tribe -- to appropriate any stray conclusion she comes across , without having any _strict_ logical right to it . Assuming _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , as the ages at first , and _D_ as the number of the years that have elapsed since then , she finds ( rightly ) the 3 equations , 2_A_ = _B_ , _C_ = _B_ + _A_ , _D_ = 2_B_ . She then says " supposing that _A_ = 1 , then _B_ = 2 , _C_ = 3 , and _D_ = 4 . Therefore for _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , _D_ , four numbers are wanted which shall be to each other as 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 ." It is in the " therefore " that I detect the unconscientiousness of this bird . The conclusion _is_ true , but this is only because the equations are " homogeneous " ( _i . e . _ having one " unknown " in each term ), a fact which I strongly suspect had not been grasped -- I beg pardon , clawed -- by her . Were I to lay this little pitfall , " _A_ + 1 = _B_ , _B_ + 1 = _C_ ; supposing _A_ = 1 , then _B_ = 2 and _C_ = 3 . _Therefore_ for _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , three numbers are wanted which shall be to one another as 1 : 2 : 3 ," would you not flutter down into it , oh MAGPIE , as amiably as a Dove ? SIMPLE SUSAN is anything but simple to _me_ . After ascertaining that the 3 ages at first are as 3 : 2 : 1 , she says " then , as two - thirds of their sum , added to one of them , = 21 , the sum cannot exceed 30 , and consequently the highest cannot exceed 15 ." I suppose her ( mental ) argument is something like this :--" two - thirds of sum , + one age , = 21 ; [** therefore ] sum , + 3 halves of one age , = 31 and a half . But 3 halves of one age cannot be less than 1 and - a - half ( here I perceive that SIMPLE SUSAN would on no account present a guinea to a new - born baby !) hence the sum cannot exceed 30 ." This is ingenious , but her proof , after that , is ( as she candidly admits ) " clumsy and roundabout ." She finds that there are 5 possible sets of ages , and eliminates four of them . Suppose that , instead of 5 , there had been 5 million possible sets ? Would SIMPLE SUSAN have courageously ordered in the necessary gallon of ink and ream of paper ? The solution sent in by C . R . is , like that of SIMPLE SUSAN , partly tentative , and so does not rise higher than being Clumsily Right . Among those who have earned the highest honours , ALGERNON BRAY solves the problem quite correctly , but adds that there is nothing to exclude the supposition that all the ages were _fractional_ . This would make the number of answers infinite . Let me meekly protest that I _never_ intended my readers to devote the rest of their lives to writing out answers ! E . M . RIX points out that , if fractional ages be admissible , any one of the three sons might be the one " come of age "; but she rightly rejects this supposition on the ground that it would make the problem indeterminate . WHITE SUGAR is the only one who has detected an oversight of mine : I had forgotten the possibility ( which of course ought to be allowed for ) that the son , who came of age that _year_ , need not have done so by that _day_ , so that he _might_ be only 20 . This gives a second solution , viz ., 20 , 24 , 28 . Well said , pure Crystal ! Verily , thy " fair discourse hath been as sugar "! CLASS LIST . I . ALGERNON BRAY . AN OLD FOGEY . E . M . RIX . G .

ALGERNON BRAY states , as a parallel case , " suppose Tommy ' s father gives him 4 apples , and he eats one of them , how many has he left ?" and says " I think we are justified in answering , 3 ." I think so too . There is no " must " here , and the _data_ are evidently meant to fix the answer _exactly_ : but , if the question were set me " how many _must_ he have left ? ", I should understand the _data_ to be that his father gave him 4 _at least_ , but _may_ have given him more . I take this opportunity of thanking those who have sent , along with their answers to the Tenth Knot , regrets that there are no more Knots to come , or petitions that I should recall my resolution to bring them to an end . I am most grateful for their kind words ; but I think it wisest to end what , at best , was but a lame attempt . " The stretched metre of an antique song " is beyond my compass ; and my puppets were neither distinctly _in_ my life ( like those I now address ), nor yet ( like Alice and the Mock Turtle ) distinctly _out_ of it . Yet let me at least fancy , as I lay down the pen , that I carry with me into my silent life , dear reader , a farewell smile from your unseen face , and a kindly farewell pressure from your unfelt hand ! And so , good night ! Parting is such sweet sorrow , that I shall say " good night !" till it be morrow .
