_Problem 1 . _ -- _A_ and _B_ began the year with only 1 , 000_l . _ a - piece . They borrowed nought ; they stole nought . On the next New - Year ' s Day they had 60 , 000_l . _ between them . How did they do it ? _Solution . _ -- They went that day to the Bank of England . _A_ stood in front of it , while _B_ went round and stood behind it . * * * * * Two answers have been received , both worthy of much honour . ADDLEPATE makes them borrow " 0 " and steal " 0 ," and uses both cyphers by putting them at the right - hand end of the 1 , 000_l . _ , thus producing 100 , 000_l . _ , which is well over the mark . But ( or to express it in Latin ) AT SPES INFRACTA has solved it even more ingeniously : with the first cypher she turns the " 1 " of the 1 , 000_l . _ into a " 9 ," and adds the result to the original sum , thus getting 10 , 000_l . _ : and in this , by means of the other " 0 ," she turns the " 1 " into a " 6 ," thus hitting the exact 60 , 000_l . _ CLASS LIST I .

Five scarves of _Z_ ' s weigh one of _L_ ' s ; 5 of _M_ ' s weigh 3 of _Z_ ' s . One of _M_ ' s is as warm as 4 of _Z_ ' s : and one of _L_ ' s as warm as 3 of _M_ ' s . Which is best , giving equal weight in the result to rapidity of work , lightness , and warmth ? _Answer . _ -- The order is _M_ , _L_ , _Z_ . * * * * * _Solution . _ -- As to rapidity ( other things being constant ) _L_ ' s merit is to _M_ ' s in the ratio of 5 to 2 : _Z_ ' s to _L_ ' s in the ratio of 4 to 3 . In order to get one set of 3 numbers fulfilling these conditions , it is perhaps simplest to take the one that occurs _twice_ as unity , and reduce the others to fractions : this gives , for _L_ , _M_ , and _Z_ , the marks 1 , 2 / 5 , 4 / 3 . In estimating for _lightness_ , we observe that the greater the weight , the less the merit , so that _Z_ ' s merit is to _L_ ' s as 5 to 1 . Thus the marks for _lightness_ are 1 / 5 , 5 / 3 , 1 . And similarly , the marks for warmth are 3 , 1 , 1 / 4 . To get the total result , we must _multiply_ _L_ ' s 3 marks together , and do the same for _M_ and for _Z_ . The final numbers are 1 × 1 / 5 × 3 , 2 / 5 × 5 / 3 × 1 , 4 / 3 × 1 × 1 / 4 ; _i . e . _ 3 / 5 , 2 / 3 , 1 / 3 ; _i . e . _ multiplying throughout by 15 ( which will not alter the proportion ), 9 , 10 , 5 ; showing the order of merit to be _M_ , _L_ , _Z_ . * * * * * Twenty - nine answers have been received , of which five are right , and twenty - four wrong . These hapless ones have all ( with three exceptions ) fallen into the error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together , for each candidate , instead of _multiplying_ . _Why_ the latter is right , rather than the former , is fully proved in text - books , so I will not occupy space by stating it here : but it can be _illustrated_ very easily by the case of length , breadth , and depth . Suppose _A_ and _B_ are rival diggers of rectangular tanks : the amount of work done is evidently measured by the number of _cubical feet_ dug out . Let _A_ dig a tank 10 feet long , 10 wide , 2 deep : let _B_ dig one 6 feet long , 5 wide , 10 deep . The cubical contents are 200 , 300 ; _i . e . _ _B_ is best digger in the ratio of 3 to 2 . Now try marking for length , width , and depth , separately ; giving a maximum mark of 10 to the best in each contest , and then _adding_ the results ! Of the twenty - four malefactors , one gives no working , and so has no real claim to be named ; but I break the rule for once , in deference to its success in Problem 1 : he , she , or it , is ADDLEPATE . The other twenty - three may be divided into five groups . First and worst are , I take it , those who put the rightful winner _last_ ; arranging them as " Lolo , Zuzu , Mimi ." The names of these desperate wrong - doers are AYR , BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE , FURZE - BUSH and POLLUX ( who send a joint answer ), GREYSTEAD , GUY , OLD HEN , and SIMPLE SUSAN . The latter was _once_ best of all ; the Old Hen has taken advantage of her simplicity , and beguiled her with the chaff which was the bane of her own chickenhood . Secondly , I point the finger of scorn at those who have put the worst candidate at the top ; arranging them as " Zuzu , Mimi , Lolo ." They are GRAECIA , M . M ., OLD CAT , and R . E . X . "' Tis Greece , but ----." The third set have avoided both these enormities , and have even succeeded in putting the worst last , their answer being " Lolo , Mimi , Zuzu ." Their names are AYR ( who also appears among the " quite too too "), CLIFTON C ., F . B ., FIFEE , GRIG , JANET , and MRS . SAIREY GAMP . F . B . has not fallen into the common error ; she _multiplies_ together the proportionate numbers she gets , but in getting them she goes wrong , by reckoning warmth as a _de_ - merit . Possibly she is " Freshly Burnt ," or comes " From Bombay ." JANET and MRS . SAIREY GAMP have also avoided this error : the method they have adopted is shrouded in mystery -- I scarcely feel competent to criticize it . MRS . GAMP says " if Zuzu makes 4 while Lolo makes 3 , Zuzu makes 6 while Lolo makes 5 ( bad reasoning ), while Mimi makes 2 ." From this she concludes " therefore Zuzu excels in speed by 1 " ( _i . e . _ when compared with Lolo ; but what about Mimi ?). She then compares the 3 kinds of excellence , measured on this mystic scale . JANET takes the statement , that " Lolo makes 5 while Mimi makes 2 ," to prove that " Lolo makes 3 while Mimi makes 1 and Zuzu 4 " ( worse reasoning than MRS . GAMP ' S ), and thence concludes that " Zuzu excels in speed by 1 / 8 "! JANET should have been ADELINE , " mystery of mysteries !" The fourth set actually put Mimi at the top , arranging them as " Mimi , Zuzu , Lolo ." They are MARQUIS AND CO ., MARTREB , S . B . B . ( first initial scarcely legible : _may_ be meant for " J "), and STANZA . The fifth set consist of AN ANCIENT FISH and CAMEL . These ill - assorted comrades , by dint of foot and fin , have scrambled into the right answer , but , as their method is wrong , of course it counts for nothing . Also AN ANCIENT FISH has very ancient and fishlike ideas as to _how_ numbers represent merit : she says " Lolo gains 2 - 1 / 2 on Mimi ." Two and a half _what_ ? Fish , fish , art thou in thy duty ? Of the five winners I put BALBUS and THE ELDER TRAVELLER slightly below the other three -- BALBUS for defective reasoning , the other for scanty working . BALBUS gives two reasons for saying that _addition_ of marks is _not_ the right method , and then adds " it follows that the decision must be made by _multiplying_ the marks together ." This is hardly more logical than to say " This is not Spring : _therefore_ it must be Autumn ." CLASS LIST . I . DINAH MITE . E . B . D . L . JORAM . II . BALBUS . THE ELDER TRAVELLER . * * * * * With regard to Knot V ., I beg to express to VIS INERTIÆ and to any others who , like her , understood the condition to be that _every_ marked picture must have _three_ marks , my sincere regret that the unfortunate phrase " _fill_ the columns with oughts and crosses " should have caused them to waste so much time and trouble . I can only repeat that a _literal_ interpretation of " fill " would seem to _me_ to require that _every_ picture in the gallery should be marked . VIS INERTIÆ would have been in the First Class if she had sent in the solution she now offers .
