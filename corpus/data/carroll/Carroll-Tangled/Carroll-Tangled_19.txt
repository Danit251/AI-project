ยง 1 . THE PIGS . _Problem . _ -- Place twenty - four pigs in four sties so that , as you go round and round , you may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last . _Answer . _ -- Place 8 pigs in the first sty , 10 in the second , nothing in the third , and 6 in the fourth : 10 is nearer ten than 8 ; nothing is nearer ten than 10 ; 6 is nearer ten than nothing ; and 8 is nearer ten than 6 . * * * * * This problem is noticed by only two correspondents . BALBUS says " it certainly cannot be solved mathematically , nor do I see how to solve it by any verbal quibble ." NOLENS VOLENS makes Her Radiancy change the direction of going round ; and even then is obliged to add " the pigs must be carried in front of her "! ยง 2 . THE GRURMSTIPTHS . _Problem . _ -- Omnibuses start from a certain point , both ways , every 15 minutes . A traveller , starting on foot along with one of them , meets one in 12 - 1 / 2 minutes : when will he be overtaken by one ? _Answer . _ -- In 6 - 1 / 4 minutes . * * * * * _Solution . _ -- Let " _a_ " be the distance an omnibus goes in 15 minutes , and " _x_ " the distance from the starting - point to where the traveller is overtaken . Since the omnibus met is due at the starting - point in 2 - 1 / 2 minutes , it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in 12 - 1 / 2 ; _i . e . _ it goes 5 times as fast . Now the overtaking omnibus is " _a_ " behind the traveller when he starts , and therefore goes " _a_ + _x_ " while he goes " _x_ ." Hence _a_ + _x_ = 5_x_ ; _i . e . _ 4_x_ = _a_ , and _x_ = _a_ / 4 . This distance would be traversed by an omnibus in 15 / 4 minutes , and therefore by the traveller in 5 ร 15 / 4 . Hence he is overtaken in 18 - 3 / 4 minutes after starting , _i . e . _ in 6 - 1 / 4 minutes after meeting the omnibus . * * * * * Four answers have been received , of which two are wrong . DINAH MITE rightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they met the other omnibus 5 minutes after they left , but wrongly concludes that , going 5 times as fast , it would overtake them in another minute . The travellers are 5 - minutes - walk ahead of the omnibus , and must walk 1 - 4th of this distance farther before the omnibus overtakes them , which will be 1 - 5th of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time : this will require 1 - 1 / 4 minutes more . NOLENS VOLENS tries it by a process like " Achilles and the Tortoise ." He rightly states that , when the overtaking omnibus leaves the gate , the travellers are 1 - 5th of " _a_ " ahead , and that it will take the omnibus 3 minutes to traverse this distance ; " during which time " the travellers , he tells us , go 1 - 15th of " _a_ " ( this should be 1 - 25th ). The travellers being now 1 - 15th of " _a_ " ahead , he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for the travellers to go 1 - 60th of " _a_ ," while the omnibus goes l - 12th . The _principle_ is correct , and might have been applied earlier . CLASS LIST . I . BALBUS . DELTA .
