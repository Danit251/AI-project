_Problem . _ --" Two travellers spend from 3 o ' clock till 9 in walking along a level road , up a hill , and home again : their pace on the level being 4 miles an hour , up hill 3 , and down hill 6 . Find distance walked : also ( within half an hour ) time of reaching top of hill ." _Answer . _ --" 24 miles : half - past 6 ." * * * * * _Solution . _ -- A level mile takes 1 / 4 of an hour , up hill 1 / 3 , down hill 1 / 6 . Hence to go and return over the same mile , whether on the level or on the hill - side , takes 1 / 2 an hour . Hence in 6 hours they went 12 miles out and 12 back . If the 12 miles out had been nearly all level , they would have taken a little over 3 hours ; if nearly all up hill , a little under 4 . Hence 3 - 1 / 2 hours must be within 1 / 2 an hour of the time taken in reaching the peak ; thus , as they started at 3 , they got there within 1 / 2 an hour of 1 / 2 past 6 . * * * * * Twenty - seven answers have come in . Of these , 9 are right , 16 partially right , and 2 wrong . The 16 give the _distance_ correctly , but they have failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been reached at _any_ moment between 6 o ' clock and 7 . The two wrong answers are from GERTY VERNON and A NIHILIST . The former makes the distance " 23 miles ," while her revolutionary companion puts it at " 27 ." GERTY VERNON says " they had to go 4 miles along the plain , and got to the foot of the hill at 4 o ' clock ." They _might_ have done so , I grant ; but you have no ground for saying they _did_ so . " It was 7 - 1 / 2 miles to the top of the hill , and they reached that at 1 / 4 before 7 o ' clock ." Here you go wrong in your arithmetic , and I must , however reluctantly , bid you farewell . 7 - 1 / 2 miles , at 3 miles an hour , would _not_ require 2 - 3 / 4 hours . A NIHILIST says " Let _x_ denote the whole number of miles ; _y_ the number of hours to hill - top ; [** therefore ] 3_y_ = number of miles to hill - top , and _x_ - 3_y_ = number of miles on the other side ." You bewilder me . The other side of _what_ ? " Of the hill ," you say . But then , how did they get home again ? However , to accommodate your views we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the opposite side , and also assume ( what I grant you is _possible_ , though it is not _necessarily_ true ) that there was no level road at all . Even then you go wrong . You say " _y_ = 6 - ( _x_ - 3_y_ )/ 6 , ..... ( i ); _x_ / 4 - 1 / 2 = 6 ..... ( ii )." I grant you ( i ), but I deny ( ii ): it rests on the assumption that to go _part_ of the time at 3 miles an hour , and the rest at 6 miles an hour , comes to the same result as going the _whole_ time at 4 - 1 / 2 miles an hour . But this would only be true if the " _part_ " were an exact _half_ , i . e ., if they went up hill for 3 hours , and down hill for the other 3 : which they certainly did _not_ do . The sixteen , who are partially right , are AGNES BAILEY , F . K ., FIFEE , G . E . B ., H . P ., KIT , M . E . T ., MYSIE , A MOTHER ' S SON , NAIRAM , A REDRUTHIAN , A SOCIALIST , SPEAR MAIDEN , T . B . C , VIS INERTIÆ , and YAK . Of these , F . K ., FIFEE , T . B . C , and VIS INERTIÆ do not attempt the second part at all . F . K . and H . P . give no working . The rest make particular assumptions , such as that there was no level road -- that there were 6 miles of level road -- and so on , all leading to _particular_ times being fixed for reaching the hill - top . The most curious assumption is that of AGNES BAILEY , who says " Let _x_ = number of hours occupied in ascent ; then _x_ / 2 = hours occupied in descent ; and 4_x_ / 3 = hours occupied on the level ." I suppose you were thinking of the relative _rates_ , up hill and on the level ; which we might express by saying that , if they went x miles up hill in a certain time , they would go 4_x_ / 3 miles on the level _in the same time_ . You have , in fact , assumed that they took _the same time_ on the level that they took in ascending the hill . FIFEE assumes that , when the aged knight said they had gone " four miles in the hour " on the level , he meant that four miles was the _distance_ gone , not merely the rate . This would have been -- if FIFEE will excuse the slang expression -- a " sell ," ill - suited to the dignity of the hero . And now " descend , ye classic Nine !" who have solved the whole problem , and let me sing your praises . Your names are BLITHE , E . W ., L . B ., A MARLBOROUGH BOY , O . V . L ., PUTNEY WALKER , ROSE , SEA BREEZE , SIMPLE SUSAN , and MONEY SPINNER . ( These last two I count as one , as they send a joint answer .) ROSE and SIMPLE SUSAN and CO . do not actually state that the hill - top was reached some time between 6 and 7 , but , as they have clearly grasped the fact that a mile , ascended and descended , took the same time as two level miles , I mark them as " right ." A MARLBOROUGH BOY and PUTNEY WALKER deserve honourable mention for their algebraical solutions being the only two who have perceived that the question leads to _an indeterminate equation_ . E . W . brings a charge of untruthfulness against the aged knight -- a serious charge , for he was the very pink of chivalry ! She says " According to the data given , the time at the summit affords no clue to the total distance . It does not enable us to state precisely to an inch how much level and how much hill there was on the road ." " Fair damsel ," the aged knight replies , "-- if , as I surmise , thy initials denote Early Womanhood -- bethink thee that the word ' enable ' is thine , not mine . I did but ask the time of reaching the hill - top as my _condition_ for further parley . If _now_ thou wilt not grant that I am a truth - loving man , then will I affirm that those same initials denote Envenomed Wickedness !" CLASS LIST . I . A MARLBOROUGH BOY . PUTNEY WALKER . II .

BLITHE has made so ingenious an addition to the problem , and SIMPLE SUSAN and CO . have solved it in such tuneful verse , that I record both their answers in full . I have altered a word or two in BLITHE ' S -- which I trust she will excuse ; it did not seem quite clear as it stood . * * * * * " Yet stay ," said the youth , as a gleam of inspiration lighted up the relaxing muscles of his quiescent features . " Stay . Methinks it matters little _when_ we reached that summit , the crown of our toil . For in the space of time wherein we clambered up one mile and bounded down the same on our return , we could have trudged the _twain_ on the level . We have plodded , then , four - and - twenty miles in these six mortal hours ; for never a moment did we stop for catching of fleeting breath or for gazing on the scene around !" " Very good ," said the old man . " Twelve miles out and twelve miles in . And we reached the top some time between six and seven of the clock . Now mark me ! For every five minutes that had fled since six of the clock when we stood on yonder peak , so many miles had we toiled upwards on the dreary mountainside !" The youth moaned and rushed into the hostel . BLITHE . The elder and the younger knight , They sallied forth at three ; How far they went on level ground It matters not to me ; What time they reached the foot of hill , When they began to mount , Are problems which I hold to be Of very small account . The moment that each waved his hat Upon the topmost peak -- To trivial query such as this No answer will I seek . Yet can I tell the distance well They must have travelled o ' er : On hill and plain , ' twixt three and nine , The miles were twenty - four . Four miles an hour their steady pace Along the level track , Three when they climbed -- but six when they Came swiftly striding back Adown the hill ; and little skill It needs , methinks , to show , Up hill and down together told , Four miles an hour they go . For whether long or short the time Upon the hill they spent , Two thirds were passed in going up , One third in the descent . Two thirds at three , one third at six , If rightly reckoned o ' er , Will make one whole at four -- the tale Is tangled now no more . SIMPLE SUSAN . MONEY SPINNER .
