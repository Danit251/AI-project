Of the eighty - two answers with which the working , or some approach to it , is supplied , one is wrong : seventeen have given solutions which are ( from one cause or another ) practically valueless : the remaining sixty - four I shall try to arrange in a Class - list , according to the varying degrees of shortness and neatness to which they seem to have attained . The solitary wrong answer is from NELL . To be thus " alone in the crowd " is a distinction -- a painful one , no doubt , but still a distinction . I am sorry for you , my dear young lady , and I seem to hear your tearful exclamation , when you read these lines , " Ah ! This is the knell of all my hopes !" Why , oh why , did you assume that the 4th and 5th bags weighed 4 lbs . each ? And why did you not test your answers ? However , please try again : and please don ' t change your _nom - de - plume_ : let us have NELL in the First Class next time ! The seventeen whose solutions are practically valueless are ARDMORE , A READY RECKONER , ARTHUR , BOG - LARK , BOG - OAK , BRIDGET , FIRST ATTEMPT , J . L . C ., M . E . T ., ROSE , ROWENA , SEA - BREEZE , SYLVIA , THISTLEDOWN , THREE - FIFTHS ASLEEP , VENDREDI , and WINIFRED . BOG - LARK tries it by a sort of " rule of false ," assuming experimentally that Nos . 1 , 2 , weigh 6 lbs . each , and having thus produced 17 - 1 / 2 , instead of 16 , as the weight of 1 , 3 , and 5 , she removes " the superfluous pound and a half ," but does not explain how she knows from which to take it . THREE - FIFTHS ASLEEP says that ( when in that peculiar state ) " it seemed perfectly clear " to her that , " 3 out of the 5 sacks being weighed twice over , 3 / 5 of 45 = 27 , must be the total weight of the 5 sacks ." As to which I can only say , with the Captain , " it beats me entirely !" WINIFRED , on the plea that " one must have a starting - point ," assumes ( what I fear is a mere guess ) that No . 1 weighed 5 - 1 / 2 lbs . The rest all do it , wholly or partly , by guess - work . The problem is of course ( as any Algebraist sees at once ) a case of " simultaneous simple equations ." It is , however , easily soluble by Arithmetic only ; and , when this is the case , I hold that it is bad workmanship to use the more complex method . I have not , this time , given more credit to arithmetical solutions ; but in future problems I shall ( other things being equal ) give the highest marks to those who use the simplest machinery . I have put into Class I . those whose answers seemed specially short and neat , and into Class III . those that seemed specially long or clumsy . Of this last set , A . C . M ., FURZE - BUSH , JAMES , PARTRIDGE , R . W ., and WAITING FOR THE TRAIN , have sent long wandering solutions , the substitutions having no definite method , but seeming to have been made to see what would come of it . CHILPOME and DUBLIN BOY omit some of the working . ARVON MARLBOROUGH BOY only finds the weight of _one_ sack . CLASS LIST I . B . E . D . C . H . CONSTANCE JOHNSON . GREYSTEAD . GUY . HOOPOE . J .
