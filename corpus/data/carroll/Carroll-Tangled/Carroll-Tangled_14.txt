_Problem . _ --" There are 5 sacks , of which Nos . 1 , 2 , weigh 12 lbs . ; Nos . 2 , 3 , 13 - 1 / 2 lbs . ; Nos . 3 , 4 , 11 - 1 / 2 lbs . ; Nos . 4 , 5 , 8 lbs . ; Nos . 1 , 3 , 5 , 16 lbs . Required the weight of each sack ." _Answer . _ --" 5 - 1 / 2 , 6 - 1 / 2 , 7 , 4 - 1 / 2 , 3 - 1 / 2 ." * * * * * The sum of all the weighings , 61 lbs ., includes sack No . 3 _thrice_ and each other _twice_ . Deducting twice the sum of the 1st and 4th weighings , we get 21 lbs . for _thrice_ No . 3 , _i . e . _ , 7 lbs . for No . 3 . Hence , the 2nd and 3rd weighings give 6 - 1 / 2 lbs ., 4 - 1 / 2 lbs . for Nos . 2 , 4 ; and hence again , the 1st and 4th weighings give 5 - 1 / 2 lbs ., 3 - 1 / 2 lbs ., for Nos . 1 , 5 . * * * * * Ninety - seven answers have been received . Of these , 15 are beyond the reach of discussion , as they give no working . I can but enumerate their names , and I take this opportunity of saying that this is the last time I shall put on record the names of competitors who give no sort of clue to the process by which their answers were obtained . In guessing a conundrum , or in catching a flea , we do not expect the breathless victor to give us afterwards , in cold blood , a history of the mental or muscular efforts by which he achieved success ; but a mathematical calculation is another thing .
